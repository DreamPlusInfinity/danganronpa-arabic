msgid ""
"You're absolutely right that you could push a dolly\n"
"without a handle if you stoop down low."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"But if you were wearing <CLT 3>that suit<CLT>, do you think you\n"
"could actually get into a position like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Wh-What do you mean...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Think back to what you said when we were all checking\n"
"out the suit together. Remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"I'm blind as a bat in here! Can't see my feet at all.\n"
"I'm surprised you got anywhere in this thing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "I'm telling you, it wasn't me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "And not to mention—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"You totally can't bend at the waist! Seems like a\n"
"pretty obvious oversight..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"When you're in that suit, not only can you <CLT 3>not see\n"
"your feet<CLT>, but you <CLT 3>can't even bend<CLT> at the waist."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Am I right about that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Now that you mention it...yeah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"It seems like it'd be awfully hard to push that dolly\n"
"if you couldn't bend over..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Well, what's to stop you from simply pushing the dolly\n"
"with your feet?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"When you can't even see your feet? You really think\n"
"someone could kick the dolly all that way?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Yeah, it'd be totally impossible! Not that I can say\n"
"for sure myself!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"On top of that, if you were wearing such a rigid,\n"
"cumbersome suit..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"...it's very unlikely you would have the dexterity to\n"
"go about wrapping the body in a tarp."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Well I mean, isn't that just a matter of taking off\n"
"the suit when you're ready to move the body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "You can't take it off by yourself"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Hiro's not strong enough"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>No, I don't think it's because Hiro didn't have the\n"
"strength. There must be another reason...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Once it's on, you can never take it off"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"What!? You mean I have to live the rest of my life as\n"
"Robo Justice!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "But I'm gonna get all moldy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "You've...already taken it off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "...Oh!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>She's right...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"There's no way the costume was taken off for the brief\n"
"time it took to move the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"I know you can do this, Makoto. I know you can find\n"
"the answer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The fact that you can't bend at the waist isn't the\n"
"only problem with that costume.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There's absolutely no chance that the costume was\n"
"taken off just to move the body. Because...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"I don't think taking off the suit was an option. If\n"
"you remember..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"I dunno what's up with this thing, but I can't\n"
"actually get it off...! A little help?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"Why would you make something that you can't take off\n"
"by yourself?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "I didn't make the stupid friggin' thing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"There's a clasp on the back that's keeping you from\n"
"getting it off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"It looks pretty sturdy. I don't think you can get it\n"
"off on your own."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "We don't really have a choice. Let's help him..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"That's true. It seems impossible to <CLT 3>put the suit on\n"
"or take it off without help<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Then...you really can't take it off by yourself? Hiro\n"
"wasn't just making it up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "O-Of course I wasn't making it up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"If he could have gotten it off by himself, I don't\n"
"think he would have let us see him wearing it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Showing up in the suit was basically an invitation for\n"
"everyone to suspect him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Y-Yeah, that's right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"So...it's really *really* true that Robo Justice\n"
"couldn't have moved the dolly...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"To be clear, whoever did move the body, it couldn't\n"
"have been Hiro in the robot suit, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"No, wait, just a second if you please. Have you\n"
"forgotten about the picture that I took?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"You all got a good look at it, did you not? The image\n"
"of Hifumi being dragged away by Robo Justice?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"If whoever was in that suit is not the culprit, how do\n"
"you explain that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"Besides, do you remember what the now deceased Hifumi\n"
"said...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "How did you get hurt?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "That guy hit me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "What guy?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Robo Justice. Er, that's what I decided to call him,\n"
"just now..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"So long as those facts exist, the proper conclusion is\n"
"beyond question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"The individual inside the suit and the culprit are one\n"
"and the same. It was Hiro, without a doubt."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Yeah...! Yeah, that's gotta be right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "H-Hold on a second!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "It's still far too early to reach that conclusion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Besides, there's no hurry to decide who did it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Before we rush to a verdict, shouldn't we explore\n"
"every single possibility?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Instead of seizing on one viewpoint, the truth is\n"
"uncovered by analyzing things from every angle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "Perhaps, but where do we go from here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"Let's review this series of unfortunate events from\n"
"the beginning. Maybe we'll uncover something new..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "Pfhah! What a pain in the ass!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"I don't disagree, but our lives are on the line. If\n"
"this is what it takes, we have to do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Plus, maybe we'll get to find out where the heck Kyoko\n"
"was when everything went down..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"Alright then, let's take another look back at what\n"
"happened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "I suppose we could start with this morning..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"Four of us gathered together in the dining\n"
"hall—Makoto, Hina, Kyoko, and myself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"We waited there for quite a while, but nobody else\n"
"showed up. So we went to look for everyone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "That was around <CLT 3>8 a.m.<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "And as soon as we split up, Kyoko went missing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Soon after that, Hina found Celeste in the rec room,\n"
"and quickly came to get Makoto and me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"It seems I was unconscious for about an hour after I\n"
"was attacked by my mystery assailant."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"I know it was an hour because I remember being\n"
"attacked <CLT 3>a little after 7<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"That was when we saw Celeste's picture and discovered\n"
"that her assailant had been wearing a strange costume."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "As it turns out, it was Robo Justice..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"It also soon became clear that this same Robo Justice\n"
"had abducted Hifumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"We were soon joined in our search by Byakuya and Toko,\n"
"and then went on to find Hifumi in the library."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"He was injured, so we took him to the nurse's office\n"
"and resumed our search for the suspect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "But not long after leaving the nurse's office..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "...!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "What's wrong...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"I saw a shadow! Something moving around at the top of\n"
"the stairs!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"When Celeste told us that, we decided to split up and\n"
"search the 2nd floor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "And soon after that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"I saw someone moving around on the 3rd floor, and I\n"
"yelled out to everyone as soon as I did."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "Celeste! What's wrong!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"That was a rather...intense scream for someone like\n"
"you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "I saw him! The strange costumed man...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid "He ran off as soon as I screamed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"I was blocking the stairs, so he headed further down\n"
"into the hallway and disappeared...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "And then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "Ungyaaaaaahhh!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "Huh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "Wh-What was that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid "That came from downstairs! It must have been..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "Hifumi! He's in the nurse's office!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid "This is bad! Come on, we have to go back!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "At that point we decided to divide up into two groups."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"Celeste, Hina, and I went back to the nurse's\n"
"office..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""
"...while Sakura, Byakuya, and Toko chased after the\n"
"suspect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"When we got back to the nurse's office, we found\n"
"Hifumi...dead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"And that's when we heard the body discovery\n"
"announcement."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"I left Celeste and Hina there and headed back to the\n"
"3rd floor, to let the others know what had happened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"Meanwhile, we had just discovered Taka's body, in the\n"
"equipment room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"We must have found both bodies at almost exactly the\n"
"same time..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"...because we heard the same announcement not long\n"
"after we'd discovered his body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "And that's when I told you guys about Hifumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "Then the three of us headed for the nurse's office."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "But right after we left the physics lab..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"...we ran into Celeste, who'd arrived after us, and\n"
"she told us something very surprising."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid "Hifumi's body has disappeared!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"We rushed back to the nurse's office and saw that she\n"
"was right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"Then we remembered we'd left Toko passed out in the\n"
"equipment room, so we hurried back again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "This can't be happening..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "Are we hallucinating all this or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"But when we got there, we discovered that now Taka's\n"
"body had *also* gone missing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid ""
"Next thing we knew, we were searching the school for\n"
"two missing dead bodies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid "And after some time..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid ""
"Celeste informed us that she'd found the bodies, and\n"
"we all headed to the repository..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid "...which is where we rediscovered the corpses."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid "I think that about covers it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"I see... The whole thing sounds exceptionally\n"
"complicated."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid ""
"It certainly seems to me that these are not a simple\n"
"series of connected events."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid "Okay, well...if that's true, then what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""
"Rather than a single series of events, I think we have\n"
"to consider each murder a <CLT 3>separate situation<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"And from there, we can uncover the <CLT 3>contradictions<CLT>\n"
"surrounding all of them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"Now then, let's get started, beginning with what\n"
"happened to Taka..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The contradictions hidden in what happened to Taka...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>In order to uncover the truth of this case, I have to\n"
"find them, no matter what!\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

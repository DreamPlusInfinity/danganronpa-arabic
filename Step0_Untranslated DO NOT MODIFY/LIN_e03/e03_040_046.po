msgctxt "0023"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"Each murder is allowed to have an accomplice, but only\n"

"So in other words, two people can work together, but\n"

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"Then there's no way anyone would work together,\n"
"right...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"So basically...you can be an accomplice if you want,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"So are you saying nobody worked together this time,\n"
"either?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"

msgctxt "0031"

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"...<CLT 3>only one blackened can graduate<CLT>. An accomplice\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"

"Then we only need to figure out who that one blackened\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Okay, okay, let me take this opportunity to clarify\n"
"the whole shebang."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"

msgctxt "0040"

"<CLT 4>So there can only be one blackened. An accomplice\n"

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "If that's true then...Kyoko, where are you?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "I have absolutely no doubt that Hiro is responsible."

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"But for the time being, I suppose it can't hurt to\n"

msgctxt "0047"

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "Well, I mean...you *are* a serial killer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"So what, I'm like a special guest suspect every time!?\n"
"I have an alibi, you know!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "She's right about that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "When we heard Hifumi scream, she was with me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"And when the bodies disappeared, she was still lying\n"
"unconscious in the equipment room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Plus, Taka's body aside, I can't imagine any way she\n"
"would have been able to move Hifumi's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Besides, I calculate every move I make! I'm not gonna\n"

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "They don't call me the murderous fiend for nothing!"

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"That's not the kind of thing you should be bragging\n"
"about!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"On another topic, should we post a guard by the bodies\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"Hina and I can handle that. You don't mind, do you\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Sure. I'd be totally useless on the investigation,\n"

msgid "Byakuya... Do you think Hiro really did it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "I don't see how anyone could think otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"When the attacks and murders and disappearances all\n"

msgctxt "0078"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "Yeah...he said <CLT 3>Hiro's<CLT> name."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "Then there is no room to suspect anyone else."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "Okay, but if he did do it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Why would he hide his identity with <CLT 3>that weird\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"Maybe he thought that no matter what happened, he'd be\n"

"<CLT 4>I feel like there's a clue hiding in there\n"

"And is that it? That's all that bothers you about the\n"
"case?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "Well, no... There are a few other things."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "Like, why did the killer try to hide the bodies?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"They probably figured that if we couldn't find the\n"
"bodies, we couldn't complete our investigation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"But if that's the case, we found the bodies pretty\n"
"easily, didn't we?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"Again, it comes back to the fact that the culprit was\n"
"a moron."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "Is that really all there is to it...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "The other thing that bothers me is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "...why'd they bother killing <CLT 3>two people<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Because all the rule says is, <CLT 3>if you can kill someone\n"
"and get away with it<CLT>, you graduate. Right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"So if you're the killer, your number one priority is\n"
"not getting caught."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"But killing two people means more clues, more chances\n"
"you'll get found out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "Hold on. Perhaps..."

msgctxt "0103"

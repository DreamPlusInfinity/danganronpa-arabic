msgctxt "0013"

"It didn't just vanish into thin air. Obviously whoever\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "But...why would they do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "I couldn't possibly begin to imagine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Anyway, our costumed suspect is clearly continuing his\n"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"We gotta hurry up and catch him, before he kills ALL\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "Oh, I don't think you have to worry about that."

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "Think about it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"

"When Hifumi's death cry went up, everyone here was\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "After that, we split up into two groups."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"And now this time, you all came here as a group from\n"
"the nurse's office."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"In other words, the only ones who could have done this\n"
"are <CLT 3>Hiro and Kyoko<CLT>, who are still missing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "H-Hold on a second!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Kyoko has an alibi for when Celeste and Hifumi were\n"

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"There's no question that she was in the dining hall\n"
"with us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Hmph. You seem very adamant about defending her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Perhaps you are...in love?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "Th-That's not it at all!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Well, anyway. Yes, I do accept Kyoko's alibi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Which means, the suspicious individual we're looking\n"
"for can be none other than...Hiro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Which further means, there will be no more murders.\n"
"The regulations are very clear about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Oh, that's right...! There's a rule that says <CLT 3>you can\n"
"only kill a maximum of two people<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"As long as that rule is in place, there will not be a\n"

msgid ""
"I'd mince ya! Mince ya without a second thought! Mince\n"
"ya, grind ya, turn ya into paste!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"By the way, did you know that fish paste can also\n"
"refer to shellfish, like shrimp or crabs!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "...Indeed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"So, since <CLT 3>two people have been killed<CLT>, there is no\n"
"possibility of any more."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"You knew that from the beginning, didn't you Byakuya?\n"
"Which means you knew Toko was never in danger..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"I still meant it when I said we'd be better off\n"
"without her, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Anyway, with that in mind, we can now relax and search\n"
"for <CLT 3>the two missing bodies<CLT>."

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The only one without an alibi, the only one who could\n"
"have done it...is Hiro.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But...is he really the killer?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>And what about Kyoko?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>If she's not involved in this case, where did she\n"

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "Hey, Makoto. What's the matter?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "Huh? Oh, no...it's nothing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Whatever. We need to find those bodies, or our little\n"
"narrative here can't move forward."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Very well. Then let us split up and begin searching."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "B-But..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"There is no need to be afraid. No more murders will\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "I-I know that. I mean, I think I do. But..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "If you're still nervous, I'll come with you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "O-Okay, thank you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "No need to thank me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "Then let's get moving. Yell out if you find anything."

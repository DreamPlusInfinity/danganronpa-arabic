msgid "Are we sure <CLT 3>Hiro really made those blueprints<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "What do you mean...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Well, take a look at this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"It's the note that Hiro wrote asking everyone to meet\n"
"up after Alter Ego disappeared."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"The <CLT 3>handwriting's<CLT> obviously different, wouldn't you\n"
"say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "When you compare it to the blueprints..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"...there's no way you could think the same person made\n"
"both of them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Unless that person made it a point to disguise their\n"
"handwriting..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "No, the differences are bigger than that, I think."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Come on, I'm not smart enough to think of trying to\n"
"change my handwriting anyway!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"So Makoto, are you saying you don't think Hiro's the\n"
"culprit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"And he's not the only one. I think Hiro is innocent,\n"
"as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Then who was in that Robo Justice suit!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Is it like Hiro said? Was there really someone running\n"
"around in a second suit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "The suspicious individual hidden within the suit..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Go ahead, Makoto. Tell them who it was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...And of course he passes it off to me.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "So? Who was in the Robo Justice suit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Hiro"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "The Illuminati"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"That's right! They're all working behind the scenes to\n"
"try and set me up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Those dudes are super scary, for serious!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Is that really true...? Maybe I should think about\n"
"this again...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "Hina"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Why me!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"That costume was super big on me! No way could I walk\n"
"around in that thing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "You saw me try it on for yourself, Makoto!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Yeah, that costume was definitely too big for Hina.\n"
"I'm sure of it...!\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "What's wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Surely you know the answer, don't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Who was in that Robo Justice suit? There's only one\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The suspicious individual in question, the one that\n"
"must have been in the suit...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"Other than <CLT 3>Hiro<CLT>...I can't think of anyone else it\n"
"could have been."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Obviously he was the one in that particular suit, and\n"
"we never found any kind of second suit..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Then there can be no doubtâ€”Hiro is the prime suspect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"That doesn't make any sense! You JUST said Hiro didn't\n"
"do it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"It makes perfect sense. Hiro was the suspicious\n"
"individual in the suit, but he's not the culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "So what you're saying is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"That's right. The culprit in this case has nothing to\n"
"do with being in the Robo Justice suit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Now that's a bold assumption!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"And what reason do you have to make such a statement?\n"
"You do have a reason, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Of course. But before we get to that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"There's something else we need to clarify first. So\n"
"let's get that out of the way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "Hey, stop trying to boss us around!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "All things have a proper order."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "So, what is it? What needs to be clarified?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"We must clarify the <CLT 3>method of transportation<CLT> for\n"
"Taka's lifeless body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"It would seem that his corpse was moved using certain\n"
"particular items."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Makoto? Can you tell us what they were?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I already explained part of this before. But there's\n"
"still one more thing...!\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"

"<CLT 4>There's still one more thing...!\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

"<CLT 4>There's still one more thing...!\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "I...think you may have misunderstood me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"What we're discussing now isn't *who* moved the body,\n"
"but *how* the body was moved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"You think that has anything to do with how the bodies\n"
"were moved...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Hey, man! You dumb!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Okay, Makoto...let's try this again. And do try to\n"
"take it seriously this time, please."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "Jeez! What kinda game are you playin' here, Makoto!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"We don't have all the time in the world. You must\n"
"realize that, right...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The things that were used to move Taka's body... They\n"
"must have been...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "They were...a <CLT 3>dolly<CLT> and a <CLT 3>tarp<CLT>, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "...Tch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>What's with the attitude?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "So, let's see if I can explain..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Taka's body disappeared from the equipment room, and\n"
"then we rediscovered it in the repository..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"And when we found it for the second time, it was\n"
"wrapped in a blue tarp, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"It was the same tarp that up until then was stored in\n"
"the equipment room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"So the killer must have seen it there and decided to\n"
"use it when they moved Taka's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"That way, they wouldn't leave any bloodstains while\n"
"they were moving it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "Okay, that explains the tarp. And the dolly?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "Same thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"I'm sure the dolly was in the equipment room when we\n"
"first found Taka's body there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "But when the body disappeared, so did the dolly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"Later, when Taka's body reappeared in the\n"
"repository..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "...so did the dolly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"In other words, you think they used the dolly to move\n"
"the body, am I right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "But are you sure you are not <CLT 3>mistaken<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Are you absolutely positive the dolly was in the\n"
"equipment room when we found Taka's body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"That dolly was made specifically for moving large\n"
"objects between the repository and the art room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"It would be very strange indeed to discover it had\n"
"made its way to the equipment room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"Is it not possible that it was in the repository all\n"
"along, and you simply didn't realize it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "She's raised an objection. How do you respond?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"There is no shame in being wrong. Nobody expects much\n"
"from you, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"We have all accepted the fact that you rarely\n"
"understand what is going on around you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Wow...I've never had anyone sound so nice while being\n"
"so mean. But maybe I can change her mind...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>If I can just explain to them why the dolly must have\n"
"been moved from the equipment room to the repository!\n"

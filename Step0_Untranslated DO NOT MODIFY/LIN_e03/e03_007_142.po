msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"It's how Chihiro earned his title of Ultimate\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"The AI lives in a computer, and by repeating different\n"

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Apparently, Chihiro used a support vector machine and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "Support vector machine...? Reinforcement learning...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"To put it simply, it's a learning method for\n"

msgid "If you wanna know more..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "...just Google it, okay!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"But if this AI continues to grow, it will become more\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Some say that an AI like this might someday *replace*\n"
"people."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"And that is why it is called Alter Ego? A fine choice\n"
"then, I must say..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"It can create memories, have thoughts, and \"grow up.\"\n"
"The process isn't much different from how humans work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"If you were to raise your own AI that way, it would\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"A second, perfect personality that can never forget or\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "Kyoko... How do you know so much about this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"Anyway, so he fixed the broken laptop and put his own\n"
"program on there. That is what this means, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"Then he brought the machine to this dressing room,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"Hmm, but you know... All this about \"Master\" and\n"

msgctxt "0094"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid "This is the most EXCELLENT 2D possible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "But he's a guy! And also a computer program!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "Oh, that aspect is no problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "That...aspect?"
msgstr ""

msgid "But I do know that things have become very grave."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "He found himself caught up in this without warning..."

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Kyoko immediately shot out another question...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "Are you asking what Master had planned for me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "Well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"He wanted me to <CLT 3>analyze<CLT> the massive number of files\n"
"stored on this laptop."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"I believe the files are related to the school, but the\n"
"protection on them is surprisingly strong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "So it's taking me a little longer than I thought."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid "But here's what Master must have been thinking..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"The fact that the files are protected so tightly means\n"
"they must contain some important secret."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "For example, perhaps...the <CLT 3>secret of this school<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>While I was busy struggling to make a sound, Kyoko\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "Umm...it's gonna be a while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"But I'm definitely gonna do it, so you can just leave\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"So because of how long it would take, he designed\n"
"Alter Ego to handle the workload."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"Smart. It also means that the work remains\n"
"uninterrupted, even after his death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Once again, Kyoko typed quickly...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid ""
"Don't worry. I've got a secret plan all ready, just in\n"
"case..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid ""
"Actually, I can see what's going on using my built-in\n"
"webcam, so if anyone suspicious shows up..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid "...I'll just scream for help real loud!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid "It's a pretty...basic plan, I have to say..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"That is fine during the day, but nighttime is a\n"
"concern..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid "Huh? Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"Have you forgotten? All our rooms are completely\n"
"soundproof."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""
"Once we close our doors, he can scream as loud as he\n"
"wants, but we won't hear a thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"Okay, then how about once it's nighttime, we each take\n"
"turns guarding the dressing room?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"There's a good chance the mastermind would notice us\n"
"all going in and out of the dressing room like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid "Then...what can we do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid ""
"Once nighttime comes, I'll leave the door to my room\n"
"open."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid "Then there's no way I can miss Alter Ego yelling."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid "B-But...if you leave your door open all night, then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid "There's a chance I may become a victim myself, I know."

msgctxt "0143"

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Yeah, it had an entirely different feel, for sure...\n"
"<CLT>"

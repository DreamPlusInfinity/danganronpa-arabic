msgctxt "0006"

msgctxt "0007"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "I'm totally out of the loop, as usual. How sad..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "Then you're the one that stole it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "That's right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"And you used it to drag Hifumi into the plan you'd\n"

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0028"

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "What...?"

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "It was Taka. He stole it."

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"But how did he do it!? She was supposed to yell if\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"You are correct. Which is why Taka forced me to steal\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "Please forgive me. He...he threatened me."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "He...abused me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"And he...he took pictures. He said if I did not do as\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "So I...I had no choice..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"

msgctxt "0049"

"He...! I mean, I knew he'd gone a little crazy,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "I never imagined he would...would go that far!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0056"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "Th-That bastard!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Bastard bastard bastard BASTARD!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "Can we allow him continue with these barbaric acts?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "Absolutely not! How could I!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "She...she..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "I have to save heeeeeeerr!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Then...would you like to join with me? It just so\n"
"happens, I have come up with a plan..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"I have devised a way to reclaim what he has stolen,\n"
"and escape this dreadful school."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "Hmhm... Hehehehe..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "And with that, it is complete..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "Huh? What are you talking about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Oh, nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Hifumi agreed without a second thought. Hmhm. The\n"
"effect that item had on him was...remarkable."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"The power of love... Even a love as twisted as that\n"
"can still drive people mad, it would seem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "You disgust me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"I have another question for you. Was that strange\n"
"costume Hifumi's creation?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "Yeah. It was a real pain in the butt, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"All I asked him to do was make something to hide the\n"
"face and general body size."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"I had no idea he'd make something like...that. But\n"
"it's my fault for picking him in the first place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "So...why'd you decide to make me the suspect?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "Because you're stupid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "That's it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"And in that regard, I made the right choice. I'm so\n"
"glad your stupidity surpassed my every expectation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "Life must have been tough on your parents, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "I feel like I could cry..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"But when you were explaining your plan to Hifumi, how\n"
"did you explain the part about him playing dead?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"What she's asking is, what was Hifumi supposed to do\n"
"after that, assuming you had actually let him live?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "That's simple."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"After he did his part and pretended to be dead, once\n"
"someone showed up..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"...I told him to say he'd been seriously wounded, he\n"
"was on the verge of death, but he just barely held on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "And he really believed that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"Well of course, that wasn't all there was to it. As I\n"
"explained it to Hifumi, the plan was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"While you were all questioning him about what had\n"
"happened to him, I was going to murder someone else."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"At that point, Hifumi would have an alibi, so nobody\n"
"could doubt him. I told him that, and he believed it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "It all seems very...straightforward. Stereotypical."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"I just matched the lie to the level of the opponent.\n"
"In fact, Hifumi ate it up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"He believed the lie wholeheartedly, right up until the\n"
"moment of his death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "So you had planned to kill him all along!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid "...But of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"There would have been no point to my plan if the one\n"
"who pretended to be dead did not end up dead himself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid "How can human life mean so little to you...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"That's a non-issue. I simply did everything in my\n"
"power to win."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "Now you sound like Byakuya!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""
"No, he derives his pleasure from the thrill of the\n"
"hunt. In that aspect, we are nothing alike."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "Then...what made you take things this far?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "Was it really...just for money?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"Are you talking about the ten million dollars Monokuma\n"
"offered us? That *is* a lot of money, it's true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "But that's not all there is to it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"From the moment our new life here began, my only\n"
"thought has been escape."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"B-But...all along you've been saying how we have to\n"
"accept living here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "Obviously that was a lie!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "Hyah!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "I couldn't take it! I hated it from day one!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid "More than anyone anyone ANYONE else in here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid "I wanted to get out! Every day was fresh torture!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "And do you wanna know why? HUH!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid "Because...I had a dream."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"And accepting a life here would have meant nothing\n"
"less than giving up on my dream forever..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "And there was no way...that I could ever do that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"In the underground world of gambling, I risked my life\n"
"to make a metaphorical killing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid "And it was all for that dream..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid "And what was this dream of yours...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid "To live in a European castle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid "A c-castle!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid ""
"And to gather handsome men from all over the world to\n"
"serve as my butlers-slash-bodyguards."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"I was going to make them dress up like vampires and\n"
"satisfy my every need."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid ""
"Once I obtained that, I would have created a perfectly\n"
"aesthetic world of decadence..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"Living the rest of my life there was my only dream, my\n"
"only goal..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid "That's what life is all ABOUT!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"Combined with my own winnings, Monokuma's ten million\n"
"dollars would have made that dream a reality."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid "I got right to the edge, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, my dream has been scattered to the\n"
"wind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid ""
"Still, I don't have any regrets. I pursued my dream\n"
"till the very end, so why would I?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid ""
"You sound so passionate, but...you were really able to\n"
"kill your own friends for it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"Are you asking me to feel guilty? That's a pointless\n"
"endeavor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"I think nothing of sacrificing others for my own ends.\n"
"I feel nothing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid ""
"That's all there is to me. That's what makes\n"
"me...complete."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"Hmhm. Isn't it terrifying how different our values\n"
"are? There's simply no room for understanding."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid "Th-That's what *we* should be saying. And plus..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid "How can you be so calm?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid "Don't you realize you're about to die?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid "Why aren't you scared...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid ""
"Hmph. My ability to lie is unrivaled, and I take pride\n"
"in that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid ""
"It's not just other peopleâ€”I can even fool my own\n"
"emotions. The conscious deceives the unconscious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid "And that's why you're not scared?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid ""
"That's right. I don't fear death. Kill me however you\n"
"like."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"

msgctxt "0150"

"Now then! This time, would you like to learn about one\n"
"of my many legends?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Your legends...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Naturally! You don't become the <CLT 3>Ultimate Fanfic\n"
"Creator<CLT> without a few legends sprouting up around you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"One such legend is how, in middle school, I was able\n"
"to convince the school to create a fanfic club!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"And from that day, I exposed myself and my fanfic to\n"
"the world at large!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"By the way, do you happen to know what all my work is\n"
"based on?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "Sorry, no idea..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Well, surely you've heard of the highly acclaimed\n"
"anime <CLT 3>Demon Angelâ˜†Pretty Pudgy Princess<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Now, you might think that that sounds totally cliche,\n"
"but you would be WRONG!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"I didn't simply copy the \"pretty girl\" Princess\n"
"Piggles style. I took a total meta sci-fi approach!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"My perspective was seen as quite odd, of course, but\n"
"if you really look at what I was doing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"...my version of Princess Piggles was the total\n"
"antithesis of the new-wave sci-fi movement."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"In fact, it was my response to J.G. Ballard's\n"
"speculative fiction stylings!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Buwheh! Ahh, my geekdom is leaking out again. I\n"
"apologize!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Anyway, unlike most fans, I never saw Princess Piggles\n"
"as your typical moe anime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "Yeah, I definitely got that impression..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"But I can't believe you were able to single-handedly\n"
"persuade the school to let you make a club..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Oh, that's because I bribed them with a cut of my\n"
"profits."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Profits...?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "And I've only gotten better at it! I'm blowin' up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Now then, up till now, I've always focused on taking\n"
"part in Princess Piggles single-setting events."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "<CLT 3>Single-setting<CLT>...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"It's when a circle gets together to come up with a\n"
"project or event focused on only one show or series."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"So a Princess Piggles single-setting event would only\n"
"allow works involving Princess Piggles, see?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"On the flipside, if there's no restriction on the\n"
"number of properties, do you know what that's called?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "Free-for-all"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Special event"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Hmm... If there's no limit or whatever, it'd have to\n"
"be a pretty large-scale kinda thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "So is it...a special event?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "*Sigh* What a boring, disappointing, wrong answer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Uh...that seems like an overreaction...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"It's the opposite of a single-setting style, right?\n"
"That should be enough of a hint!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Fan jam"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "Uhh...is it like, a fan jam or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Kh! This is why I hate newbies..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Perhaps you're thinking of game jams, which, while\n"
"interesting, are indie dev-specific!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Get it right, or pay the price!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "O-Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "You should probably take this seriously, Mr. Naegi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "What would be the opposite of a single-setting event?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>A single-setting event only allows material from\n"
"one show or series...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>And the opposite of that is when anything is allowed\n"
"from any property...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"The opposite of the single-setting event... Is it just\n"
"called a <CLT 3>free-for-all<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "That's absolutely right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"There are actually plenty of free-for-all events every\n"
"year, and yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"More and more slackers are showing up with no idea\n"
"what fanfic really means! It's so ANNOYING!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"So in order to crush these peons with all my might,\n"
"I'm going to start taking part in more free-for-alls!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Crush them...? That doesn't sound very friendly..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"I don't participate in these events to make friends!\n"
"And I cannot forgive those lazy bastards!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"And don't tell me to ignore them! If you let some\n"
"little wimp survive, you'll regret it later!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Play any RPG where the villain spares the hero when\n"
"he's level 1, and what happens? Boom! Dead!"

"<CLT 4>I...kinda get it. But I kinda don't...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"It's a dog-eat-dog industry, where only the most\n"
"brutal survive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Oh, but don't worry. I'm gonna start you off easy by\n"
"getting you involved in some simple <CLT 3>cosplay action<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Huh? I'm gonna get involved? ...Wait, did you say\n"
"cosplay!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"You're a pretty good-looking guy. If your costume was\n"
"decent enough, I might even let you work my booth!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Bwehehe... I bet you could even net yourself a magical\n"
"girl harem!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"So with that in mind, let's change the world of fanfic\n"
"together!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "...What does that even mean?"

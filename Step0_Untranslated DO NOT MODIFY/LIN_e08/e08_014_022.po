msgctxt "0002"

"<CLT 4>Jeez, if there's anyone who can say no to someone who\n"

"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Sure, I'd love to learn more about you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Okay. But...what do you want to know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Well, let's see... What kind of program are you\n"
"working on now? I bet it's pretty amazing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Oh! Actually, I just started the research process for\n"
"something..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"You remember that database software I told you about?\n"
"I'm retooling it into something <CLT 3>a little more complex.<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"But I signed an NDA with the company that hired me, so\n"
"I can't really go into the details..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Yeah, they probably wouldn't want the wrong people to\n"
"hear about it, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"It's not that I don't trust you or anything! I\n"
"just...made a promise, you know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "S-Sorry..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"No, it's okay. It's my fault for asking about\n"
"something you couldn't talk about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Oh, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "...maybe I can give you a little hint."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "It has to do with <CLT 3>simulating human thoughts<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Artificial intelligence"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Virtual reality"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Are you talking about virtual reality?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Nope, not quite!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Virtual reality is less about our thoughts and more\n"
"about our senses."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"It doesn't have a physical form, of course, but the\n"
"illusion is real enough to convince most people."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"We just call virtual reality \"VR\" for short. What I'm\n"
"talking about has a short nickname like that, too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "Robotics"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Are you doing robotics research?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"Hmm... Not exactly. Although the two fields are\n"
"definitely connected."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Sorry, I can't give you any more hints."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "But you're smart. I know you can figure it out!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>She said it has to do with simulating human thoughts,\n"
"right? Which must mean...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"You're developing some kind of artificial\n"
"intelligence, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "Ah! You figured it out!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Was my hint too easy...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Ahh, what am I gonna do? If they find out I broke my\n"
"promise, they might..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "Don't worry. I'm not gonna say anything to anyone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Y-Yeah, I know... I know I can trust you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Okay, I guess I can tell you about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"I'm working on a type of artificial intelligence the\n"
"world has never seen before."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"It's what we call a <CLT 3>strong AI<CLT>. It's designed to\n"
"think like a human, to process any mental task we can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "A strong AI...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"You see, in the field of artificial intelligence,\n"
"there's strong AI and weak AI."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Weak AI isn't meant to match human intelligence. It's\n"
"simply a type of problem-solving software."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"A weak AI isn't actually thinking, it's just executing\n"
"actions programmed into it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Strong AI, on the other hand, is a program that can\n"
"achieve true <CLT 3>self-consciousness<CLT>â€”full ego awareness."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"In other words, a strong AI is a complete entity, a\n"
"computer program capable of becoming aware."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"But it's always just been a hypothesis. Plenty of\n"
"experts don't think it's even possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"It sounds like something from a sci-fi movie... And\n"
"you're working on something like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Well like I said, right now I'm just researching it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"I've made lots of progress on the programming side,\n"
"and the intelligence development..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"...but when it comes to actual awareness, it's still a\n"
"long way off. It might even be impossible..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "Really...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "I'm not sure how to put it, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "No matter how well designed or complex a program is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"No matter how closely the software can simulate the\n"
"workings of the human brain..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "...I don't think that's enough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"If the program is only *simulating* thought, it will\n"
"always be <CLT 3>lacking something<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Lacking...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "Well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "I guess you could say...a <CLT 3>soul<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"If you could somehow pour your own soul into the\n"
"software, maybe then a strong AI could be created."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Wait...a soul?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I know. It's not a programming term. I'm not\n"
"even sure how that would work on a technical level."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "S-Sorry, forget I mentioned it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Anyway, all I have right now is the theory. There's\n"
"still lots of research left to do."

"<CLT 4>Artificial intelligence sounds like a pretty tough\n"

"I wasted your time on another boring topic. I must\n"
"have bored you to death, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "No, the complete opposite! It was really interesting!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "You mean it...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "Okay! Next time we talk, I wanna hear about you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Oh, well... Unlike you, I really *am* boring."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "No excuses! It's your turn next time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "O-Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"

"<CLT 4>When she says it like that, I think the only way to\n"

"Ahem! I do apologize for keeping you waiting. Now\n"
"then, let's <CLT 3>resume<CLT> the class trial!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"We've all just learned of the shocking revelation that\n"
"Chihiro was actually a <CLT 3>boy<CLT>! Let's pick up from there!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Yes, well...I don't know his reason for hiding it, but\n"
"the fact is, Chihiro was not a girl, but a boy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>To think that Chihiro...was actually a guy.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The thought had never even crossed my mind...\n"

msgctxt "0006"

"And because the victim was male, he would have had no\n"
"problem gaining access to the boys locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Assuming his handbook did, in fact, list his gender as\n"
"male...then yes, that would be true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Of course <CLT 3>his handbook said he was a boy<CLT>! He dressed\n"
"like a girl, but he was a boy through and through!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"So then, there should be no issue with Makoto's\n"
"initial assertion..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"The victim was killed in the boys locker room, and was\n"
"then later moved to the girls locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"And the killer could have easily used Sayaka or\n"
"Junko's handbook to get into the girls locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "So Chihiro really was killed in the boys locker room!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"I still don't understand the motive for moving the\n"
"body, but...yes, that does seem plausible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Well...I must admit, I did find it rather odd..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"I knew he felt a little...off. There was a certain\n"
"incongruity to his \"female\" body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "This is a most titillating situation!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"So now everything has been connected. All the\n"
"mysteries have finally become clear."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Okay, well, connected or clear or whatever... We still\n"
"think *you're* the killer, remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Hmhm. Very interesting. This has become very\n"
"interesting indeed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Ahh, he's off in his own little world..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"What about you, Makoto? After everything we've\n"
"learned, do you still think Byakuya's the killer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Well, without a doubt Byakuya's the one that made\n"
"Chihiro's death look like Genocide Jack did it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "But...but I..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "I think he might not actually be the killer after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"What? But aren't you the one who accused him in the\n"
"first place?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"He just seems to be too...easygoing about all this.\n"
"Like he's enjoying us solving the mystery..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"The way he's acting, it makes it seem like it doesn't\n"
"have anything to do with him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"And you think that might be because it *doesn't* have\n"
"anything to do with him?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Plus, the evidence he left behind was a little\n"
"too...how can I put it? Overt."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"He consciously chose to use the extension cord,\n"
"knowing it could connect him to the murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "At least, that's how I see it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"And Byakuya, when you found out the murder took place\n"
"in the boys locker room, it seemed to rattle you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"And then again when you found out Chihiro was actually\n"
"a guy..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"If you really were the killer, that stuff wouldn't\n"
"have had any effect on you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"So that's your thinking, huh? Well, it bothers me that\n"
"you don't have more concrete reasons, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"It's fine. I guess I'll mark it as correct, for the\n"
"time being."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Mark it as...correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "He's right. I am not the culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"I just happened to come across the corpse in the girls\n"
"locker room, and decided to <CLT 3>alter<CLT> it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Are you fucking with us right now...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"No, I am not...effing with you right now. I'm telling\n"
"you <CLT 3>the truth<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "Well I find it very hard to believe!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"Go ahead, find it very hard to believe. You're free to\n"
"be executed along with the rest of us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"If you're really telling the truth, then...why? Why'd\n"
"you do that to his body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"My reasons hardly matter right now. Uncovering the\n"
"culprit is much more important, wouldn't you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Now then...if it wasn't me, who was it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"W-Well...I don't think I can say for sure without\n"
"talking about it a little more."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"We're seriously gonna keep going? We're all good,\n"
"aren't we? I thought it was clear Byakuya did it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"No, I'm with Makoto. If there's any doubt whatsoever,\n"
"we need to explore every possibility."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Because if we're wrong, we all die here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "...That's true. Very well then, I'm with you, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Damn straight! Count me in!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Do you not have a mind of your own!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Of course I do! What am I, an ant or somethin'?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Anyway, let's discuss this all as a group one more\n"
"time. We still have time to make our decision."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "That's very true..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"

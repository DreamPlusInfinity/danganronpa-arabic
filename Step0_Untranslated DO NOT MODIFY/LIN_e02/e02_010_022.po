msgctxt "0042"

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"In game theory, what we are going through now is\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"In this type of game, in order for one person to gain\n"

msgctxt "0045"

msgctxt "0053"

msgctxt "0054"

"If those who want to escape were to disappear, there\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "At least one of you seems to understand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"It is because I am the same as you. Games are meant to\n"

msgctxt "0088"

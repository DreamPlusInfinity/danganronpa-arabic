msgctxt "0009"
msgid "She fainted"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Are you talking about her fainting?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Well...I can say it's close, but not quite. Fainting\n"

msgctxt "0032"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"

msgctxt "0043"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""

msgid ""
"She said a murderous fiend lived within her, and she\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"And that trepidation is what's caused her to have such\n"

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Urg...gaah...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"

msgctxt "0071"

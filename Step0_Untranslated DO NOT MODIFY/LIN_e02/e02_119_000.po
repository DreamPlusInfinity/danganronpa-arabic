"I believe someone else did see the victim before he\n"
"was murdered. What do you think, <CLT 3>Celeste<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Now that you mention it, yes. I did see him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Huh? Really?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Oh, but I suppose only Makoto knows about this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"The rest of you had no idea, did you? That is why\n"
"you're all making such ugly noises."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Whatever, just hurry up and tell us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"It was last night, right before nighttime. I saw\n"
"Chihiro...in the dormitory <CLT 3>warehouse<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "I saw him stuffing a <CLT 3>track jacket<CLT> into a duffel bag."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "And then, I assume, he headed off to exercise."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"A track jacket and a duffel bag? But we didn't find\n"
"anything like that at the murder scene!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"It seems likely that the culprit destroyed them to get\n"
"rid of any evidence..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"And that's when he said something that struck me as\n"
"rather odd..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "Well...I'd better get going. I'm kind of in a hurry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Chihiro told me he was \"<CLT 3>in a hurry<CLT>.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"But why would he be in a hurry? Only if someone were\n"
"<CLT 3>waiting for him<CLT>, I should think."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"So Mr. Fujisaki was on his way to meet with someone,\n"
"and then they were going to work out together...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"But Hina and I had invited him to exercise with us\n"
"plenty of times, and he always declined..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Probably cuz he was afraid you'd find out the secret\n"
"he was hiding, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Which means that conversely, he must have trusted\n"
"whoever he was meeting with very much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Enough so that he was willing to risk his secret being\n"
"revealed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Uhuhu! What a marvelous friendship!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"The point is, whoever he met up with is the culprit,\n"
"right? So we just gotta figure out who it was!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "But knowing what we know, I can't even guess..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"...No, you already have what you need to make the\n"
"connection."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "...Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "You know who the killer is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "S-Seriously!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Wh-Who is it!? Who's the killer!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"Think back to the track jacket and duffel bag the\n"
"killer disposed of."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Focus on the details of these items, and it should\n"
"become obvious who was waiting for him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "...Are you sure about that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"You really think we can figure out who did it based on\n"
"two pieces of evidence that we don't have?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"What, you wanna track down some fingerprints or\n"
"something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Even if we had the equipment for that, we wouldn't\n"
"know how to use it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"As was noted, the evidence is already gone. There's\n"
"nothing to get fingerprints *from*."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Maybe, but we *can* make certain <CLT 3>inferences<CLT>, if we\n"
"just take the time to talk it out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Easy for you to say..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"But fineâ€”Celeste, did you notice <CLT 3>anything special<CLT>\n"
"about the bag or jacket?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"The bag was...just a <CLT 3>normal duffel bag<CLT> from the\n"
"warehouse."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"All the bags in there are the same, so I can't imagine\n"
"what would make that one special..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Well, if I remember right, there was a <CLT 3>decent\n"
"variety<CLT> of tracksuits to choose from..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Do you think there might be some connection between\n"
"the culprit and Chihiro's jacket?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Perhaps. Let's explore that, and talk a bit more about\n"
"the <CLT 3>jacket<CLT> he took."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Does Chihiro's track jacket really hold some clue\n"
"about the killer?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Somehow...it's really hard to believe...\n"

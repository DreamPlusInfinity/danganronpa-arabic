msgid "Hold on a second, Mondo! What did you <CLT 3>just say<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "...Huh? What'd I say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "When Celeste testified a few minutes ago, she said..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "I saw him stuffing a track jacket into a duffel bag."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "And then, I assume, he headed off to exercise."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "She never said anything about the <CLT 3>jacket's color<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "So why did you say Chihiro's \"<CLT 3>blue<CLT>\" tracksuit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "What are you—!? You just—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Hey, Celeste. What color *was* Chihiro's tracksuit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "As a matter of fact, it was...<CLT 3>blue<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"And before we began the trial...did you tell anyone\n"
"that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "The only one I told about any of this was you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Then...Mondo, how did you know what color Chihiro's\n"
"tracksuit was?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "B-Because I—! I just—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"I-I'm sure he saw the clothes at some point in the\n"
"investigation...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "No, that can't be it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"The bag and clothes were surely disposed of by the\n"
"time we began our investigation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Then the only reason he could have known what color\n"
"the tracksuit was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"...is if he saw Cherry with it before he died! That's\n"
"the only possibility!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Cherry...? Are...are you talking about Chihiro?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"So, how 'bout it!? Did you see the the tracksuit or\n"
"didn't you!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"J-Just by chance... I just happened to see it last\n"
"night..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"He walked past me, and he was carrying the tracksuit\n"
"in his hands."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"No, that can't be it, either. According to Celeste's\n"
"testimony..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"She stuffed the jacket into her bag in a hurry. It was\n"
"almost like she was trying to hide it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "And just like that, she was gone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"When Celeste noticed it, Chihiro made a point of\n"
"making sure the jacket was <CLT 3>completely in the bag<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"If you just ran into him briefly, you couldn't\n"
"possibly have seen what color the tracksuit was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "Gh—! Nggh...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "It would appear you've dug your own grave."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Perhaps, but you handed him the shovel, didn't you?\n"
"That's why you said what you did..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"Focus on the tracksuit, and it'll be obvious who he\n"
"met with? What a bunch of nonsense..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"...Ah, now I understand. It was all one big bluff,\n"
"wasn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Your true intention was to draw a <CLT 3>slip of the tongue<CLT>\n"
"from the culprit..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"That's why you said you knew who did it, to put them\n"
"on edge."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "That's right. However..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"Mondo was my target all along. I had my suspicions\n"
"about him from the very beginning!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "But why...? What made you so suspicious?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "The way he talked"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "The way he was acting"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0043"

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "That's a good question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "There was a certain turning point that tipped me off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Maybe you didn't notice it, Mondo, but you tend to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"

"You only call guys \"<CLT 3>dude<CLT>.\" For girls, it's\n"
"\"<CLT 3>chick<CLT>.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"And after he was killed, you happened to refer to him\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Once I picked up on that, it occurred to me that\n"
"<CLT 3>Mondo knew something we didn't<CLT>."

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "Y-You noticed such a tiny detail!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Are you a witch? She's a witch! You're positively\n"
"frightful!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "No, I'm not the frightful one."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Not nearly as frightful as <CLT 3>someone capable of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Kh...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Mondo...was it really you?"

msgctxt "0061"

"criminal!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Y-Yeah! He would never do something like that! This is\n"
"a false accusation!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "It's true, my reasoning on that is pretty shaky."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "Th-That was fast..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Well, this does present us with a problem. It seems we\n"

msgctxt "0067"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "Hmmm? What do you have there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0077"

msgctxt "0078"

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "For a fact indeed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "I was totally sure I'd found it!"

msgctxt "0095"

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"...Well, that's what I was hoping. But it's busted. It\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"I imagine the culprit broke it to get rid of any\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"That's odd. I didn't think the handbooks were quite\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "You're right, they're not!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"They're totally waterproof and shock-resistant! It\n"

"And yet, this one does appear to be broken. As is\n"

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "How, precisely, did the handbooks get broken?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "By hitting its weak point"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "By exploiting a bug"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"Too bad for you, but those things have been debugged\n"

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "By hacking it"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"Maybe they were able to physically hack into it and\n"
"destroy it that way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"I told you, it's impossible to modify it! Try to open\n"
"up its guts and a security buzzer goes off!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>O-Oh yeah...I guess I can cross hacking off the list,\n"

"<CLT>"

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid "What's wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid "Do you have something you want to say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"You know, Monokuma said something very interesting\n"
"earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>How did the handbook break? There's only one possible\n"
"explanation...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"You already told us before that the handbook has one\n"
"<CLT 3>weak point<CLT>, didn't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid "Ugyah! You remember that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid ""
"S-Sure, maybe I let that slip, but I never told anyone\n"
"what the weak point actually was!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid ""
"But if the handbook is supposed to never break, and\n"
"two of them broke in quick succession, then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid ""
"Then we can only assume that someone's figured out its\n"
"weakness."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid ""
"You know what the weakness is, right Monokuma? So,\n"
"what is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid "Huh? You're asking me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"I think it's a necessary piece of information if you\n"
"want this to be a fair trial."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid ""
"But...if I tell you, and someone else decides to copy\n"
"it, that would be very not good..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"Just tell us already! Why would we wanna break our own\n"
"handbooks!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""
"*sigh* Oh well... I have a weakness for pushy demands.\n"
"But you're sure you won't follow their example?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"Then allow me to make a special announcement! The weak\n"
"point of my cutting-edge e-Handbook is...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"When it's exposed to high temperatures for too long,\n"
"it will suffer a meltdown and totally brrreak!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid "I flippin' knew it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid "...You knew it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid ""
"Yeah, cuz I found the handbook laying on the floor of\n"
"the <CLT 3>sauna<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"The temperature in the sauna can reach over 200\n"
"degrees. Strange how you don't get burnt, huh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"It's because as your sweat evaporates, it creates a\n"
"cooling layer of air around your skin!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid ""
"If the hot air of the sauna were somehow pushed\n"
"directly onto your skin, you'd definitely get fried!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"That layer of air would get blown away. That's why you\n"
"may feel a burning when you move around."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid ""
"So when you're in a sauna, make sure to keep nice and\n"
"still!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid "Wow, interesting! I learned one new fact today!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid "That is a mere trifling speck of knowledge!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid ""
"Anyway... If you found the victim's handbook in the\n"
"sauna..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid ""
"...then the killer must have been purposely trying to\n"
"raise its temperature in order to break it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid "Meaning the culprit somehow knew its weakness..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid ""
"But how'd they find out? Monokuma said he didn't tell\n"
"anyone, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid "Indeed, quite the mystery..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"
msgid "What if they found out by accident?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0150"
msgid "What do you mean, by accident?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0151"
msgid ""
"What if the killer took their own handbook into the\n"
"sauna, not knowing its weakness, and it broke?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0152"
msgid ""
"They'd realize it was broken, of course, and it\n"
"wouldn't be hard to figure out why."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0153"
msgid ""
"And once they had Chihiro's handbook, they knew they\n"
"had an easy way to dispose of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0154"
msgid ""
"I won't say it's not possible, but...who would have\n"
"done something like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0155"
msgid ""
"I don't know of anyone who took their handbook into\n"
"the sauna..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0156"
msgid "...I might know someone who did."

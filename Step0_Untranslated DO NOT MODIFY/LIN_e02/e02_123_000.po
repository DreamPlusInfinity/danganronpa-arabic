"Mondo, the handbook you have right now... Is it really\n"
"<CLT 3>yours<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "...The fuck is that supposed to mean!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "The <CLT 3>broken handbook<CLT> that was in the main hall..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Isn't that one actually yours?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "What the heck are you talking about!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"What I mean is, I think Mondo <CLT 3>swapped<CLT> his handbook\n"
"out for one that actually works."

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"I think he took Leon's handbook and replaced it with\n"

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"After all, Monokuma said himself that Leon's handbook\n"
"never should have broken."

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"That's right! The punishment it suffered wasn't nearly\n"
"enough to destroy it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"So then, the broken handbook in the main hall is\n"
"actually <CLT 3>Mondo's<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Which would mean that the handbook Mondo has right now\n"
"is actually <CLT 3>Leon's<CLT>, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"But doesn't that violate the school regulation that\n"
"says <CLT 3>loaning out your handbook<CLT> is prohibited?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "Well, here's how I look at it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"There is a rule about loaning your handbook to another\n"
"student. But if they're dead, they're not a student!"

msgid ""
"It's kind of a grey area, I admit, but no worries! If\n"
"anything, it just makes things more interesting!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"As such, I decree that exchanging handbooks with a\n"
"corpse is not a violation of the rules!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Well, Mondo? If I'm wrong about this, you're welcome\n"
"to say so."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "I'm happy to admit I made a mistake, but..."

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "S-Son of a bitch...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "What's wrong, bro? Come on, tell him he's wrong...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "You ARE wrong! You HAVE to be wrong...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "Everything you just said is wrong! You made it all up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Okay, then why don't we look back on this case one\n"
"more time, from the beginning?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"That way, everything will become clear, and we'll all\n"
"see if I was right or wrong!"

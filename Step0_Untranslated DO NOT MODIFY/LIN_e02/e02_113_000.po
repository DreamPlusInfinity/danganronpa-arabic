"<CLT 4>Evidence that shows the murder took place somewhere\n"

"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There was something that was switched between the boys\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"The proof that she was killed somewhere else is...the\n"
"<CLT 3>poster<CLT> that's hanging in each locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "Your proof...is some posters?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid "The poster in the girls locker room was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"...a picture of a <CLT 3>big-boobed supermodel<CLT>. But don't\n"
"you think that's kind of strange?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"Why would the girls locker room have a poster like\n"
"that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"I bet those massive jugs of hers were totally fake!\n"
"Kyeehahaha!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "Meanwhile, the boys locker room had..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "...a poster of the super popular boy band <CLT 3>Tornado<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"Again, that doesn't really seem to belong in a boys\n"
"locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "So you're saying that maybe the posters were switched?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"And there's one other thing I noticed about the locker\n"
"rooms..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "You know what I'm talking about, right Sakura?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "You're referring to my <CLT 3>protein coffee<CLT>, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "...Protein coffee?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"While I was in the girls locker room earlier, I\n"
"spilled some protein coffee on the carpet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"But I noticed that after the murder, the stain had\n"
"been totally scrubbed away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>No. It's not that the stain was scrubbed away...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "Makoto... What does this have to do with anything?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"Yeah! Are you trying to twist what happened and get us\n"
"all confused again!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"We already knew about that. There must be something\n"
"else, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"No, you've got it all wrong. Just calm down and think\n"
"about it carefully."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"Could you possibly have been more wrong? I'm ashamed I\n"
"wasted any amount of time listening to you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid "What is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "Are you thinking about the coffee stain?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"Go ahead, start talking. If something comes to me,\n"
"I'll back you up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>It was moved...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"The stain on the girls locker room carpet wasn't\n"
"scrubbed away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid "In fact, I found it on the <CLT 3>boys locker room carpet<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid "That's...definitely the stain from my protein coffee!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid ""
"Then...does that mean that the carpets were switched,\n"
"too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid "But...why would anyone do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid ""
"To move the murder scene from one locker room to the\n"
"other. It's certainly plausible, don't you think?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid ""
"In other words, in order to completely swap the scene\n"
"of the crime..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"...the bloodstained <CLT 3>poster<CLT> and <CLT 3>carpet<CLT> were moved\n"
"along with the dead body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""
"By doing this, the killer was able to change the\n"
"entire room where the murder took place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"I can certainly follow your reasoning, but...why would\n"
"the culprit bother doing that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid ""
"Why would they go to all that trouble of switching the\n"
"scene of the crime?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid ""
"Actually, an even bigger question... If the murder did\n"
"take place in the <CLT 3>boys locker room<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid ""
"...then how did Chihiro get in the boys locker room in\n"
"the first place?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid "Ah—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"To get into the locker rooms, you have to swipe your\n"
"<CLT 3>e-Handbook<CLT> across the <CLT 3>card reader<CLT> device."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid ""
"But Chihiro's handbook should have only allowed her\n"
"access to the girls locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"She had no way to get into the boys locker room to\n"
"begin with."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid ""
"No, <CLT 3>she DID have a way<CLT>! And I can tell you what it\n"
"was!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid "I highly doubt that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid ""
"Shut up! I'm telling you, I know how she could have\n"
"done it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"

"<CLT 4>Is he right...? Could Chihiro really have gotten into\n"

"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0026"

"To begin, there are two notable characteristics in\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "The first characteristic..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"...is that at every crime scene, <CLT 3>the word \"bloodlust\"\n"
"is written in the victim's own blood<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "And the second..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"...is that when the victims are murdered, their bodies\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>\"Bloodlust\" is written in blood, and the victim's body\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Save your surprise. The best part is yet to come."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"For the second characteristic, where the <CLT 3>victims are\n"
"suspended<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"The only ones who knew about that particular fact were\n"
"members of the police and other higher-ups."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "By all accounts, nobody in the media ever found out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"In other words, no one on the news, no one online,\n"
"*nobody* knew about that aspect of each crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"Only key officials and the killer himself knew about\n"
"this act of \"mounting\" the victim."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "Now, if you recall Chihiro's corpse..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "Her body was most certainly mounted in this fashion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"So...how could the killer have <CLT 3>known about suspending\n"
"the victim<CLT>...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "That's the key question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "But in fact, the answer is quite simple."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"The culprit isn't a copycat killer... It's <CLT 3>the real\n"
"Genocide Jack<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "...Gh!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"That right there is the <CLT 3>evidence<CLT> that Genocide Jack\n"

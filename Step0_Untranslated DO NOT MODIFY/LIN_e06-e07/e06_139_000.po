"The moment I lost my memories... I can't think of any\n"

msgid ""
"When I first came to the gates of this school,\n"

"<CLT 3>When I passed out<CLT>...I was overcome with a strange\n"
"sensation..."

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Wow! You still have enough spirit to keep on talking,\n"
"huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Umm, so I don't know much about the details, but it\n"
"seems like everyone remembers passing out, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"And your sense of time got all messed up because of\n"
"the memory loss after that...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "I guess it musta been something like that!"

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"After I passed out, I woke up in a classroom, with my\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"I assumed not much time had passed since I'd collapsed\n"
"in the main hall."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Ahaha. But instead, <CLT 3>two whole years<CLT> had gone by!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"The reason it felt so short was because...our memories\n"
"of the time in between had been completely removed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"You got it, honey! Two years of memories, poof, gone!\n"
"Which means, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"When everyone met for the first time, it wasn't\n"
"actually for the first time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Unaware of this fact, you took the time to introduce\n"
"yourselves to each other. But..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"But by that point, we'd already spent two years\n"
"together at the school."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "That's what those photos reveal, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Puhuhu... Yup! That's what they reveal!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"You were all such close friends. You spent two years\n"
"together. And then you started killing each other!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"And it was all so you could escape into a world that's\n"
"already been annihilated!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Puhuhu. What a terribly tragic tale... Even if you\n"
"left now, there's nothing you could do to fix it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"

msgctxt "0025"

"Once your school life here began, I thought about you\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "It's only natural that I would...fall in love."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"So since I love you guys so much, I'll tell you all\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"School life during that first year overflowed with\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Oh boy, it was just the worst!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Everyone was enjoying themselves so much. You were all\n"
"having the time of your lives!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"But that couldn't last forever, of course. The\n"
"peacefulness only made it through that first year..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Because after that, an event unfolded that hammered a\n"
"soul-crushing despair into all of humanity."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"The biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human\n"
"history... <CLT 3>The Tragedy<CLT>."

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"All too soon, the world's days of peace came to a\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "And as you can imagine, the school was no exception."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"The Tragedy even made its way here, leading to the\n"
"extermination of most of the students."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "What...are you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Hm? What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"The most tragic event in human history, and the\n"
"\"Ultimate Despair\" that caused it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"I can't believe it's all because of just you and\n"
"Mukuro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"Was it some kind of organization? An angry mob? An\n"
"incredibly motivated family?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "You have a point. If I had to describe it, I'd say..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"It was none of those. How can I put it? It was more of\n"
"an ideological thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"<CLT 3>Despair is contagious<CLT>, you know. It's almost\n"
"like...a natural phenomenon."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "Everyone is capable of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "And now, the entire world has fallen into despair."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"In other words, if you see despair as the enemy, then\n"
"your enemy...is <CLT 3>the world itself<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "I just don't understand why..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"We didn't ask you to try to understand. This was a\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Okay, so let's get back to the story..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Hope's Peak had taken so much damage. You guys were\n"

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"The members of <CLT 3>the 78th class of Hope's Peak Academy<CLT>\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "And then, something super neat happened!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Now pay attention, cuz this is important and I'm only\n"
"gonna say it once!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"So guess what! To protect everyone who had survived,\n"
"Hope's Peak was transformed into a <CLT 3>shelter<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "That's right! It was transformed into a <CLT 3>shelter<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Ahh! I said it twice!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Now, someone was <CLT 3>responsible<CLT> for that transformation,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Are you seriously suggesting that I would deliberately\n"
"create a shelter to *protect* you guys!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>She's right. If it was for our protection, there's\n"

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "Come on. This isn't that kind of story."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"You must have found at least one clue that can lead\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>A clue? Maybe she means... I was watching something,\n"

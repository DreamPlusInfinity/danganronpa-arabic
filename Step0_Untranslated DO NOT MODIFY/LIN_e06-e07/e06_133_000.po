msgctxt "0003"

"Goddamn straight it was money! Celeste killed Hifumi\n"
"and Taka for a little personal gain!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Blackmail"

msgctxt "0010"

"That's it! Monokuma blackmailed Ogre to get her to\n"
"kill us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Hey! What you call blackmail, I call doing business!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"

msgctxt "0013"

"<CLT 4>There's no doubt that Monokuma tried to coerce Sakura\n"
"into killing one of us...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But that's not what led to Sakura killing *herself*.\n"
"There was another reason...\n"

msgctxt "0015"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"So you're saying the desire to hide her secret was the\n"

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Um, well...not quite..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>It's true that she kept a secret from us...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But what's important right now isn't *that* she hid\n"
"something, it's *what* she hid...\n"

msgctxt "0022"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "That fourth murder! Or suicide! Or whatever Sakura!"

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The trigger was when Monokuma exposed what Sakura had\n"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

"<CLT 4>What was it that made Sakura decide to kill\n"

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>It had to do with Monokuma exposing Sakura's secret...\n"

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So the theme of the motive in that fourth case was...\n"
"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "In her case, it was <CLT 3>betrayal<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Precisely. You see..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Once I revealed Sakura's betrayal, that led to\n"
"everything that came afterwards..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Anyway, it looks like you answered all of my questions\n"
"correctly. How painfully delightful..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"But what's the point? What meaning is there in asking\n"
"those questions now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Relationships, secrets, money, betrayal..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"These are all pretty standard motives, right? The most\n"
"normal of normal, totally middle of the road!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"But of course those aren't the only motives that exist\n"
"in this world..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"In fact, there are as many reasons to kill as there\n"
"are people on Earth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"They compel humans to kill each other, bringing\n"
"despair to the world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "This is what we refer to as <CLT 3>the seed of despair<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Seed of despair...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Just as water, air, and food promote growth in living\n"
"things, the seed of despair also needs <CLT 3>nourishment<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"And that nourishment...is <CLT 3>hope<CLT>! Despair can grow\n"
"only in the presence of hope!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"Two sides of the same coin, divided by a razor-thin\n"
"line... Such is hope and despair!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "...How much longer is this stupid speech of yours?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Weren't we discussing our missing memories? Why are\n"
"you trying to change the subject?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"If you would listen, you would see I'm *not* changing\n"
"the subject. We *are* discussing your memories."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"What I'm trying to say is, the \"seed of despair\" is\n"
"closely tied to your own memories."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "H-How so...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"You see, by taking away your memories, I gave you\n"
"hope."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Of course, that hope merely existed <CLT 3>to be consumed by\n"
"despair<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"How could taking away someone's memories...give them\n"
"hope?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "And plus, you haven't given us any hope anyway!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Is that so? All you've been able to think about during\n"
"your time here is how to escape, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"The mere fact that that's what you want proves I gave\n"
"you hope."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "What are you talking about...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"If none of you <CLT 3>wanted to escape this school<CLT>, the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"That is why we took your memoriesâ€”so that you would\n"
"have <CLT 3>the desire to leave<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"The only reason we want to leave is because you took\n"
"our memories... Is that what you're saying?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Puhuhu... Correctamundo!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Which means, if we *did* have our memories, then we\n"
"*wouldn't* want to leave. Do I understand that right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Wh-What!? Why the HELL would having our memories make\n"
"us not wanna leave!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "Puhuhu... A most troubling thought, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"But it's not enough. I want more distress, more\n"
"despair...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"I put so much effort into creating hope in order to\n"
"feed your despair and make it grow..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"So, just like Crazy Eddie slashing his prices and\n"
"passing the savings on to you, lemme give you a hint!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "Huh? Really!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Then h-hurry up and tell us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "Okey dokey! Like they say, seeing is believing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "So something really did happen out there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Now are you interested in what I have to say? You\n"
"wanna see what's out there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "Puhuhu. I wanna see, too..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "See your faces sink into despair...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Ah-hahahaha! Now then, OPEN SESAME!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "Behold, the world beyond the school walls!"

msgctxt "0086"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"

msgctxt "0088"

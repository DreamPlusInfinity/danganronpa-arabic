msgid "[let down their guard]"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"So when was it that the mastermind let their guard\n"
"down...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"I wasn't there to hear it myself, but do you remember\n"
"what the mastermind said?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"They said they had <CLT 3>hijacked the airwaves to broadcast\n"
"our school life to the outside world<CLT>, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Y-Yeah, they definitely said that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"And what did you think when you heard that? Pretty\n"
"hard to believe, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Well...I mean, the idea of actually taking over the\n"
"airwaves seems so...unbelievable."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"You don't exactly read about something like that\n"
"happening very often, so it's hard to imagine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"In other words, that kind of thing is extremely\n"
"difficult to pull off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "And yet somehow...the mastermind was able to do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"But think of it another way—there must have been some\n"
"reason they *had* to do something that difficult."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "A reason...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"They had to show the world something, no matter the\n"
"cost—us killing each other."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "They wanted to show the world...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"The mastermind has been very adamant about not killing\n"
"us directly, but <CLT 3>forcing us to kill each other<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"And all their rules and regulations were designed to\n"
"encourage that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Yeah, that makes sense. If those stupid regulations\n"
"didn't exist, nobody would've killed anybody..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"So the mastermind's ultimate goal was to make us kill\n"
"each other, and show that off to the world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "But...why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "To prove a point, most likely."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Prove...a point?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"The outside world has a name for the students of\n"
"Hope's Peak, right? A certain concept..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "You're talking about \"hope,\" right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"And for those of us who represent <CLT 3>hope<CLT> to kill each\n"
"other and sink into <CLT 3>despair<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"The mastermind wants the world to see that, to try and\n"
"prove that <CLT 3>despair<CLT> is better than <CLT 3>hope<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "That's their goal, as the Ultimate Despair."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>They want to prove that despair...is better than hope?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "But that...that's ridiculous!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"You're right. It *is* ridiculous, completely\n"
"irrational."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"It's the kind of thing that nobody but those who call\n"
"themselves the Ultimate Despair would devise."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"That group whose only purpose and motivation comes\n"
"from despair..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"B-But—! Is that really their only reason for making\n"
"the rest of us suffer!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "I know how angry it must make you. And yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"...that same motivation is what led to the mastermind\n"
"revealing their weakness."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"Because their goal is to broadcast this killing game\n"
"to the world..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"...the mastermind has had to be more particular than\n"
"is reasonable about their own regulations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"If the mastermind simply ignored their rules, this\n"
"wouldn't have been a \"game,\" but a one-sided slaughter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"At least, that's how <CLT 3>those who are watching this<CLT>\n"
"would have seen it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"And that's why the mastermind couldn't kill any of us\n"
"themselves?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "That is precisely the reason."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"No matter how much they may hate what I'm doing, I\n"
"haven't violated a single one of their regulations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Junko broke the rules, so she was punished. But in my\n"
"case, they couldn't lay a finger on me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"So instead, they tried to use the class trial,\n"
"following all their proper rules, to get me killed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"They began a trial that didn't have a right answer,\n"
"then made me out to be the killer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "But even that didn't work..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Yes, thanks to you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"And due to that failure, the mastermind took yet\n"
"another risk."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"They attempted to kill you instead, who *also* was not\n"
"the killer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"And when that fact was exposed on live TV to the\n"
"entire outside world..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "...the mastermind had to accept your suggestion?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"To prove to the world that despair is better than\n"
"hope, they have to defeat us in perfect form..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"It would only do the mastermind harm to have it shown\n"
"that they'd violated their own regulations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"But all of that was a hunch, right? And you were still\n"
"able to get the mastermind to accept your challenge..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"Well, it's only thanks to you that we got that chance.\n"
"Because you believed in me, another path opened up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Still, I can't believe how much of the mastermind's\n"
"thoughts and plans you were able to figure out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "I didn't have the slightest clue..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"In the end, though, I couldn't prove any of it. It was\n"
"just my reasoning. Essentially, I was making a bet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"But it looks like I got it right. This time, at least,\n"
"I won the bet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>She let out a quick sigh. I took it as a small sign of\n"
"relief.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"To be honest, I haven't been that nervous in a long\n"
"time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "I totally couldn't tell you were nervous at all..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"You seemed totally confident from the moment we\n"
"decided to go talk to him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Well, presenting a strong demeanor is a fundamental\n"
"part of negotiation and persuasion, wouldn't you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Plus, if I'd showed my uneasiness, that would have\n"
"just made you that much more uneasy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Yeah, you're probably right. How pathetic...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "Anyway, we can't relax just yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"All we've done is earn another chance to fight. We\n"
"have to win this time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Or everything we've gone through will have been for\n"
"nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"

msgid ""
"But before we begin the final battle, we have to tell\n"
"the others what's going on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "True, but now we know who our real enemy is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"All we have to do now is work together with everyone\n"
"to destroy the mastermind...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "Work together with everyone..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Is that really possible?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "...Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "Anyway, right now we have to go find the others."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "They're probably in the dorms somewhere. Shall we go?"

msgctxt "0092"

msgctxt "0093"

msgctxt "0094"

"B-But honestly, why would the mastermind agree to\n"
"that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"I mean, they don't stand to gain anything from a final\n"

msgstr ""

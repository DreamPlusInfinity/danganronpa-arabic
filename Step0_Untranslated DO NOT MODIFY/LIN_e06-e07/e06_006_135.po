msgid "Last class trial...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "We're going to redo Mukuro's trial."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "What!? Seriously!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"What's the point of redoing it? Makoto killed her,\n"
"right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "No, I didn't do it! Like I keep telling you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Makoto isn't the killer. And of course it's not me or\n"
"any of you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Th-Then...who is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"What she's saying is, it was all the work of the\n"
"mastermind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "What!? You're saying the mastermind killed Mukuro!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"That's right. It was all an elaborate trap contrived\n"
"by the mastermind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Makoto spotted the trap in time, and did what he had\n"
"to to stop it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"But his decision meant that *he* would be the one to\n"

msgctxt "0015"

msgid ""

"But executing Makoto, who *wasn't* the blackened, is a\n"
"clear violation of the school regulations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"The rules state that *only* the blackened is to be\n"
"executed. The mastermind broke their own rules."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Which is why I went and negotiated with them to have\n"
"the trial one more time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"And the mastermind agreed!? Does that mean they really\n"
"did break the rules...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"They had no choice but to agree. You used the TV\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "Very observant of you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "I recall what you said at the end of the last trial..."

msgctxt "0024"

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"For anyone who doesn't understand, you can ask Kyoko\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "So, knowing all th-this...what do we do now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"It's about who killed Mukuro, right? So our job is to\n"
"expose the mastermind...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "But there's more to it than that, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "Um, yeah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"For us to win this time, we have to solve every last\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Every last mystery...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"But we've been looking around all this time, and we\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"You've probably guessed already, but if we lose this\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "E-Everyone!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"H-Hey! Who said you could agree to those t-terms\n"

msgctxt "0038"

"I, meanwhile, want to get out of here as soon as\n"
"humanly possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"Anyway, at this point the only way for us to survive\n"
"is to unravel the truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"In other words, one decisive final battle. A rather\n"
"interesting development, I'd say."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"But figuring out who the mastermind is, AND how they\n"
"killed Mukuro, AND all the school's mysteries..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "It's a pretty tall friggin' order..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Maybe, but this time the trial is different. We know\n"
"who our enemy is now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"So if we work together and search as hard as we can,\n"
"I'm sure we'll solve all those mysteries!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "I'm not so sure about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "...Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"I <CLT 1>[can't agree]<CLT> with the idea of working together\n"

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "[Can't agree]"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "You...can't agree? Why not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"I mean, working together with everyone seems like the\n"
"most obvious way to solve all the mysteries..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "That's what I thought, too...at first."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Until Monokuma gave us that little hint of his..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Hint...?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... It's a very polarizing approach, I know,\n"
"but—okay, enough puns. Anyway, here's a hint..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "I'm sure I told you this already, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"...this <CLT 3>killing game<CLT> began with sixteen\n"
"participants, all of them high school students."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"And the only people to take a single step in Hope's\n"
"Peak since the killing game began..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "...are those sixteen students."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "Monokuma said that, did he?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Then Kyoko's opinion is perfectly reasonable."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Huh? But why...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"If the mastermind really is the one who killed Mukuro,\n"
"as Kyoko says..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"...then the mastermind would have had to set foot in\n"
"this school, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Monokuma could probably murder Mukuro, but there's no\n"
"way he could have disguised the scene like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"But according to Monokuma, the only people who have\n"
"set foot in Hope's Peak..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"...are the <CLT 3>sixteen students<CLT> who have been taking\n"
"part in the killing game."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "Then...the m-mastermind is...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"There were fifteen of us in the m-main hall at the\n"
"very beginning..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Add in M-Mukuro, and you get sixteen..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "So the mastermind w-would have to be...one of them?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"And of those sixteen people we started out with, the\n"
"only ones still alive..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"...are the people standing right here. Need I\n"
"continue, or do you get it now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "You're saying the mastermind is one of us!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Y-You can't be serious!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "W-Wait! We can't say for sure that's true yet!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Monokuma might have just said all that to confuse\n"
"us...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"It's certainly a possibility. But only one among\n"
"many..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"The mastermind being one of us is *also* a\n"
"possibility."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "And that is one possibility we can't ignore."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"Yeah! I mean, they're an u-ultimate, right? The\n"
"<CLT 3>Ultimate Despair<CLT>. So they m-must be a high schooler!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "You can't say it's not p-possible...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"But if one of us was the mastermind, they'd have to be\n"
"controlling Monokuma somehow, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"But did you ever see anyone acting suspicious anytime\n"
"Monokuma was active?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Maybe they s-snuck off and controlled him i-in\n"
"secret..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"I don't care how sneaky you are, we would've noticed\n"
"someone sneaking off that many times."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"Then maybe Monokuma was on autopilot! Maybe they\n"
"loaded up all the dialogue and actions beforehand!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"In that case, there's no way he could have had all\n"
"those back-and-forth conversations with us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Well...it wouldn't be entirely impossible, if they\n"

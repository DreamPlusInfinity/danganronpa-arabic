"<CLT 4>After leaving the garbage pit, we found ourselves in a\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There was a metal ladder leading up into the tunnel.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>We started climbing the ladder, intent on reaching the\n"
"surface.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The ladder was impossibly long; I couldn't even see\n"

msgctxt "0005"

"<CLT 4>We climbed into darkness...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The passage was so dark and cramped, I couldn't even\n"

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "I had no idea we were so far down..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Don't lose your footing. If you slip, I won't be able\n"

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Y-Yeah, I'll be careful..."

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But now that you said that, I'm getting kind of\n"

msgctxt "0012"

"<CLT 4>Maybe talking will help keep my mind off it...\n"

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "Um, so Kyoko...there's something I wanted to ask you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"You said you're the <CLT 3>Ultimate Detective<CLT>, right? So\n"
"how long have you been doing detective work?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "How long...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "Ever since I can remember."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"I come from a long line of detectives. Detective work\n"
"is in my blood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"There was a time when being a detective was considered\n"
"a sacred duty. My family's always seen it that way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Then...is your family famous?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Quite the opposite, actually."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Even among actual detectives, many people haven't\n"
"heard of us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Huh? But...how come? It's like your family tradition,\n"
"right? So..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Because we take pride in it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Pride...?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "A detective is neither light nor shadow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"We represent neither justice nor evil. That is how we\n"
"can uncover the absolute truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"We stand neutral in all things. And to do that, we\n"
"have to stand separate from the rest of society."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Which is why we've made a conscious effort to conceal\n"
"our existence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "A conscious effort...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"It's kind of old-fashioned, and I can't say it's\n"
"entirely rational..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"But it's our family creed, and we do what we must to\n"
"protect it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Because, like I said, it's our source of pride."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Pride...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So that explains...\n"

"<CLT 4>Before I came here, when was looking up info about the\n"
"school online, I never saw anything about her.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Because she hid herself on purpose, to protect the\n"
"pride of her family...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "And yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "I...gave up some of that pride."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"In order to enter Hope's Peak, I had to reveal myself\n"
"to the school."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"I did it knowing it was something a true Kirigiri\n"
"detective would never do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But the reason you gave up that pride...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The reason you would go so far to enter Hope's Peak...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"It was because that's how much you wanted to reconnect\n"
"with your dad, right? There's no shame in that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Reconnect...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"I had absolutely no desire to reconnect with my\n"
"father."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"B-But...you'd be reuniting after all those years,\n"
"right? You would've had so much to talk about..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "There's nothing I want to talk to my father about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "There is something I want to *say* to him, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"No matter what it takes, I have to find him and tell\n"
"him, face to face..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Wh-What is it...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "I want to sever all ties with him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Sever...?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "The last time I saw him..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "...I was still very young."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"So I don't remember myself, but apparently he was\n"
"extremely intelligent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"He was in line to become the next head of the Kirigiri\n"
"family. He was talented, he had a promising future."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "But he had no interest in detective work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "So he cut himself off from the family."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Not long after that, my mother died, and he\n"
"simply...ran away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"He went to my grandfather, and they had a huge\n"
"argument. And young as I was...he left me behind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "I-I'm sure there was a reason for that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "I'm sure your dad wanted to take you with him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "If that's true, then I need to thank him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "Thank him for leaving me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Because unlike him, I take <CLT 3>pride<CLT> in the work I do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "I take <CLT 3>pride<CLT> in my family name."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"So every last part of me is happy he didn't take me\n"
"with him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"If I'd gone with him, I never would have had the\n"
"chance to become a detective."

"<CLT 4>I was above Kyoko on the ladder, so I wasn't able to\n"
"see her expression.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So I couldn't tell...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I couldn't see how she looked when she said that,\n"
"what she might have been feeling.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>All I could tell was that compared to her usual\n"
"self...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...she was more talkative.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>And more emotional.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"I don't blame him, you know. He had his own life to\n"
"live."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"That's what anyone in my position might say, right?\n"
"But it's not true..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "But there's one thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "One thing that I can never forgive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "Really...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "The way everyone else looked at me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"I was never sad about being left behind. Like I said,\n"
"I think it was a good thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"But when the rest of my family looked at me, they saw\n"
"something different."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"They only saw me as <CLT 3>the little girl that was\n"
"abandoned by her father<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid "That's how they see me even to this day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"His shadow has been following me my entire life. I'm\n"
"sick of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"I need him out of my life. I need to step out of his\n"
"shadow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"That's why I have to find him, and tell him we're no\n"
"longer family."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "In order to settle the past..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "In order to remove him from my life forever..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "I have no doubt he forgot about me years ago."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"B-But...you're family. To just cut him out like\n"
"that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "Our only connection is through blood, nothing more."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "Are we connected by heart and soul? No."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "Is blood really enough to call someone family?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Only connected by blood, not by heart or soul...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I was so shocked to hear her say something like that,\n"
"I didn't know how to respond.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So instead...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...I said nothing.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I just kept climbing the ladder in complete silence.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>And after I don't know how long...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...we finally reached the top.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "Looks like this is it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"On the other side of this door...Hope's Peak is\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "We're...back."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "Remember that hatch on the ground near the trash room?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "I'm fairly certain that's where we'll come out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"I unlocked it earlier, so it should open without much\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid "Well, here goes nothin'..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I reached my right hand up and pushed against the\n"
"hatch.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The hatch opened with ease. And so...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "Looks like we're back..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"But I can't believe how long that ladder was. I'm\n"
"exhausted..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I can't exactly say we're safe and sound, but...at\n"
"least we're out of there.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Now we're back in Hope's Peak Academy...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"Kyoko...thank you. I never would've gotten out of\n"
"there without you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "No thanks necessary. I was just returning the favor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "So...now what do we do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"I'm glad I didn't die, of course, but if the\n"
"mastermind finds out..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid ""
"And I'm worried about you, too. You helped me, so they\n"
"might..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid "You're worried?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid "Y-Yeah, of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid "Then let's just get a concrete answer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"Let's ask Monokuma if there's a problem with you\n"
"escaping."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid "W-Wait, that's—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"If we try to hide, it's only a matter of time till\n"
"we're found out. And it's not like we can run away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>As she said that, she pointed at the nearby\n"
"surveillance camera.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"So you're saying rather than stressing out over\n"
"getting caught, we should just give up now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid "Don't worry. What you think is going to happen, isn't."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid "Because the mastermind is the one that's ensnared."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The mastermind is ensnared...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid ""
"You said something like that before. What does it\n"
"mean...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"The mastermind stood exposed during the investigation\n"
"into Mukuro's death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"There was a moment where the mastermind let their\n"
"guard down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid "There was...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid "If we can talk to Monokuma, we can confirm it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid ""
"And it'll be better for us if we go to him directly\n"
"before he tracks us down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid "That should help with our negotiations..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I'm still a little—no, super uneasy about this.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid "But...we don't really have a choice, do we?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid "Monokuma should be in the gym."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid "Let's get going."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid "Let's head to the gym. Monokuma should be there."

msgctxt "0149"

"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0157"
msgid ""

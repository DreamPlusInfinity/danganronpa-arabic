msgctxt "0016"

"Well, we don't have any way to refute it, so we have\n"

msgctxt "0017"

msgctxt "0032"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"You don't remember choosing to live here forever. Or\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"

msgctxt "0039"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Indeed. We only have one path in front of us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Th-Then...we really...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Yup! You all totally lost your memory at the same\n"
"time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "This is all...making my head hurt..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "And this isn't like some normal kind of memory loss."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"You <CLT 3>stole those specific memories<CLT> from us, didn't\n"
"you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Oopsie! You figured that part out too, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Of course. There's no way we would all just happen to\n"
"get amnesia at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "B-But...how could someone just s-steal our memories?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "How...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Come come come, that hardly matters right now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"If I said it was hypnotism, would you believe me? Or\n"
"we opened up your skulls and messed with your brains?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Would you really believe anything I said? How it\n"
"happened doesn't matter right now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"What matters is figuring out <CLT 3>what memories<CLT> you took\n"
"from us. That's what you're trying to say, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Puhuhu! I knew I could count on you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"The interview with the headmaster, taking that group\n"
"photo... Those can't be the only memories we lost."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"There must have been a purpose to it all. A reason for\n"
"taking away our memories..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Of course there was a purpose! It all has to do with\n"
"the original <CLT 3>motive<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The original motive...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"You mean the \"motive\" you came up with to try and get\n"
"us to all kill each other?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"That has something to do with the memories you stole\n"
"from us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Puhuhu! It sure does!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "But that part's still a secret...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Anyway, I'm sure it's not easy, but let's all focus on\n"
"the <CLT 3>class trial for the murder of Mukuro Ikusaba<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Okay, so you want us to figure out who killed her\n"
"before we do anything else..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So until we do that...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Well either way, we have to explain every last\n"
"remaining mystery.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"

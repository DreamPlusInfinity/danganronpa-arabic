msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"She was so pretty, like a princess. And she could\n"

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"I honestly believed that as long as you kept chasing\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"But to do that, you can't take your eyes off of your\n"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Even if sometimes it's a bad dream... Whether you're\n"

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"In that world, if you lose focus for even a split\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"You have to keep on swimming against the current,\n"

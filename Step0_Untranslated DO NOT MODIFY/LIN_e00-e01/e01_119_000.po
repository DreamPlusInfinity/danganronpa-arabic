msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "Perhaps it was the work of a fairy..."

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Hifumi had the key, so the only way the incinerator\n"
"could have been turned on without his knowledge..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"...was because the killer was able to hit the switch\n"
"*without* opening the gate."

msgctxt "0032"

"Once they'd gotten the incinerator going, all they had\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"But the distance from the gate to the incinerator has\n"

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"The pinpoint accuracy you'd need to throw a glass ball\n"

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "Th-That's right! There's no way! It'd be impossible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""

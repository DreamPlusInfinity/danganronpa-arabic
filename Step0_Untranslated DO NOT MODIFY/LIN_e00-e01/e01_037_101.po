"Cleaning duty? As a matter of fact, that's me. Why do\n"
"you ask?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"It just so happens Monokuma talked to me yesterday and\n"
"asked me to take care of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Without someone on cleaning duty, the school would be\n"
"flooded with trash in no time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "So I formally applied for the position!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"I was gonna start this morning, but after what\n"
"happened, I haven't had a chance to get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"And since you're on cleaning duty...you can open the\n"
"gate in front of the trash room?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "Of course!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"It's my job to gather up all the garbage and toss it\n"
"in the trash room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"And to do that, they gave me the key for the trash\n"
"room gate!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"But we're supposed to rotate once a week, so\n"
"eventually you'll be in charge."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Wait, hold on..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"You need a key to get in the trash room? And only the\n"
"person on cleaning duty has access to the key?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "What's the point of going to all that trouble?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Why not just leave the trash room open all the time so\n"
"we can all throw things out whenever we want?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "That does seem more convenient."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "So I wonder why..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Actually..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"

"<CLT 4>Anyone who kills a fellow student and becomes\n"
"\"blackened\" will graduate, unless they are discovered.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "That must be why."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"If anyone could go in and out of the trash room\n"
"whenever they wanted..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"...then destroying evidence would be easy. The thrill\n"
"would disappear, and things would become boring."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "B-Boring...!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "That doesn't matter right now! My question is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Hey fatty! Why'd you want the cleaning duty gig,\n"
"anyway!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"I-I just decided to volunteer for something I knew no\n"
"one else would wanna do. What's the big deal!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "Liar! I know why you did it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"You wanna dig through all the girls' trash! Looking\n"
"for...y'know...and poking around at it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "What are you talking about!? All my love is for 2D!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"But there's all kinds of trash diggers like that!\n"
"Maybe you'll get tired of 2D, and then turn to—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "I would NEVER get tired of 2D!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"After spending a significant amount of time comparing\n"
"2D and 3D, I voluntarily chose 2D!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"The only thing 3D is good for is to shower love and\n"
"affection on 2D!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"How are you not totally embarrassed to say stuff like\n"
"that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Whenever a guy has cleaning duty, Sakura can accompany\n"
"them, from picking up the trash to disposing of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Whaaat!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"If you're as innocent as you claim, where's the harm\n"
"in it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Kh—! That's not how it's supposed to—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Anyway, on another topic... Hifumi, since you were on\n"
"cleaning duty, I have a favor to ask you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"What, so now you suddenly want to join my party?\n"
"Sorry, but you haven't triggered that flag yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"I mean, you haven't helped me recover from a past\n"
"trauma, or save a village, or beat a boss..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"No, nothing like that... I was just hoping to get into\n"
"the trash room and look around."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Oh, okay!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "So easy...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "So, Hifumi and I headed down to the trash room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Cleaning duty...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Taka would prolly know more about that, I bet. He's\n"
"pretty uptight about stuff like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Cleaning duty? What is that...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Honestly, I have no idea. Maybe you should ask Taka.\n"
"Or someone else. Anyone but me, really."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Cleaning duty, eh? As a matter of fact, Monokuma came\n"
"and talked to me yesterday morning!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "Really!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"He probably realized I was basically in charge, so he\n"
"decided to talk to me directly!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"The topic of conversation was...assigning cleaning\n"
"duty!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "Oh, so you're on cleaning duty now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Actually, no."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Huh? Okay, then who is?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"Hifumi was also there when we had this conversation.\n"
"He volunteered right away, so I let him have it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "So *he's* on cleaning duty, then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Indeed. But we'll swap out on a weekly basis. I'm sure\n"
"you'll be up before too long."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "And when that time comes, I'll be counting on you!"

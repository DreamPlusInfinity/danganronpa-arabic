msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"And once everything comes to an end, the outcome will\n"

msgctxt "0109"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"

msgctxt "0116"

msgid ""
"What a smart little chimpanzee you are! Look at you,\n"
"implying you didn't do it without actually saying it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"So it's basically what the outside world calls a \"lay\n"
"judge\" system, or an inquisition type thing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"Which means you'll be deciding who you think the\n"

"Last night, the killer went to the room Sayaka was in.\n"
"In other words, <CLT 3>my room<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"From what we can tell, Sayaka invited that person\n"
"there intending to kill them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"She attacked them with the knife she'd taken from the\n"
"kitchen earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"...but then something happened that she wasn't\n"
"prepared for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"They grabbed the <CLT 3>fake sword<CLT> I'd put in my room, and\n"
"fought back."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"During the struggle, a strike from the sword <CLT 3>broke\n"
"Sayaka's right wrist<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"And that's when she lost her grip on the kitchen\n"
"knife."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Finding herself cornered, Sayaka panicked and ran into\n"
"the <CLT 3>bathroom<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"The killer went after her, but couldn't get the\n"
"bathroom door open."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"What they didn't know was that my bathroom door <CLT 3>got\n"
"stuck easily<CLT>, and there was a trick to opening it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Sayaka knew about that because I'd told her, but of\n"
"course the killer had no way of knowing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"So instead, the killer forced the door open, took the\n"
"kitchen knife..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "...and stabbed Sayaka."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"But with what strength she had remaining, Sayaka left\n"
"a <CLT 3>dying message<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"To keep the killer from noticing, she wrote it on <CLT 3>the\n"
"wall behind her<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "And with that, all her strength was gone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"With Sayaka dead, the killer quickly began destroying\n"
"the evidence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"First, they took off their <CLT 3>shirt<CLT>, which was covered\n"
"in their victim's blood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Then they took the <CLT 3>lint roller<CLT> in my room and\n"
"cleaned up the entire area."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"They wanted to make sure they got rid of any trace\n"
"they'd ever been there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Afterwards, the killer headed to the <CLT 3>trash room<CLT> to\n"
"destroy their bloody shirt."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"They tried to burn the shirt using the <CLT 3>incinerator<CLT>\n"
"there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"But the trash room was blocked off by an especially\n"
"sturdy gate, preventing access to the incinerator."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"So they came up with a plan to use Hiro's <CLT 3>crystal\n"
"ball<CLT>, which he'd left in the laundry room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"The killer managed to <CLT 3>throw the ball<CLT> through the gap\n"
"in the gate and hit the incinerator's switch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"For any normal person, that'd be an impossible throw,\n"
"but the killer had the confidence to take a shot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"And that's because the killer...was the <CLT 3>Ultimate\n"
"Baseball Star<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"The crystal ball, thrown with absolute precision, hit\n"
"the switch on the incinerator..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "...which then quickly roared to life."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Having destroyed the final piece of evidence, they\n"
"left the area with, I imagine, a sigh of relief."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "But there was one thing they missed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"<CLT 3>Part of the shirt<CLT> they'd thrown into the fire burnt\n"
"away and fell out of the incinerator."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"The killer didn't notice this, and so left behind a\n"
"piece of indisputable evidence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Isn't that right...<CLT 3>Leon<CLT>!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"

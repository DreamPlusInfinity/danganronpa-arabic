msgctxt "0005"

msgctxt "0007"

msgid "I spent some time looking around the dormitory, and..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"There I made the discovery of the century! I found\n"
"that there was exactly one room for each person!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Well yeah, I figured that out before anything else..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Each door already has a nameplate on it, so I guess\n"
"all the rooms have been assigned already."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"

"<CLT 4>Which confirms that the room I was in earlier is, in\n"

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Your next-door neighbor could scream their lungs out,\n"
"and you wouldn't hear a thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Well, each room also had a private bathroom,\n"
"which could also lock."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"But it looked like there were only locks on the\n"

msgctxt "0020"

"<CLT 4>Huh? But when I checked my bathroom door before, it\n"

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"It has nothing to do with communicating with the\n"

msgid ""
"In both the school and dorm areas, there was a set of\n"

"<CLT 1>[Byakuya]<CLT> and <CLT 1>[Taka]<CLT> each went off on their own,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid "Huh? What am I, a parakeet?"

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""

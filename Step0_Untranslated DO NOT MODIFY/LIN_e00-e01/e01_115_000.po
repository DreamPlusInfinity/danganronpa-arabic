"Actually, no. I don't think the fight <CLT 3>started with\n"
"the sword<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Huh? Why not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Because the sword's sheath had been <CLT 3>scratched<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"See? There's a gash in it, like someone cut into it\n"
"with something sharp."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Something sharp... You mean, like the kitchen knife?\n"
"That was the only sharp thing found at the scene..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Stop jumpin' ahead! Slow down and explain it so I get\n"
"what the hell's goin' on!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"If the sword was used first, there wouldn't be any\n"
"explanation for the scratch on the sheath."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"If you were going to attack with the sword, you'd take\n"
"it out of the sheath first, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"That's true. With the sheath on, it'd be heavy and\n"
"bulky and useless as shit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Okay, so how *did* the sheath get damaged?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"If they got attacked with the kitchen knife, maybe\n"
"they grabbed the sword as a defensive impulse."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"In that situation, there wouldn't be any time to\n"
"actually unsheathe the sword."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"So you're saying the sword was initially used to\n"
"defend against an attack from the knife..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Which means whoever had the kitchen knife...was the\n"
"one who attacked first!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "I think I get it! So here's how it all played out..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"The culprit came in, found the kitchen knife hidden\n"
"there somewhere..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Then they took the knife and attacked Sayaka before\n"
"she knew what was happening!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"So she grabbed the sword to defend herself, but then\n"
"the culprit took that from her, too...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Then, after they broke her wrist with the sword...they\n"
"took the knife and...finished it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Sorry, but I don't think Sayaka used the sword to\n"
"defend herself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Wh—!? How the hell can you not think that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Because she never held the sword at all. There's a\n"
"<CLT 3>certain part of her body<CLT> that makes this clear."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"

"In fact, if you look you'll notice that a lot of the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"

msgctxt "0040"

"There's really no way she could have picked it up and\n"

"Which brings up another point... Makoto, Sayaka was\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "Maybe the reason she wanted to switch rooms..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "Sayaka wanted to—on me!?"

msgctxt "0099"

msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"That would also explain why she would switch the\n"

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"She wanted to get whoever she had targeted to come to\n"
"Makoto's room, where she was staying..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"And by committing the murder there, instead of her\n"
"room, that would implicate Makoto."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"But for that to work, the target had to be lured out\n"
"while still keeping the room swap a secret."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"If the target knew she had switched rooms, they would\n"
"have become suspicious right away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "So all that's why she switched the names...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "But doesn't that plan seem a little risky?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"For one thing, even if her plan worked, Mr. Naegi\n"
"would just tell everyone they'd switched rooms."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"I don't know... I'm not sure our softhearted Makoto is\n"
"capable of that kind of cutthroat behavior."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"I'm sure Sayaka realized the same thing, which is why\n"
"out of all of us, she asked him to switch rooms."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "P-Plus...she *was* the <CLT 3>Ultimate Pop Sensation<CLT>..."

"out...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "Holy shit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "But in the end, her plan backfired."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"She launched her attack with the knife, then found\n"
"herself under attack in turn."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"That must be when her wrist got broken, and she was\n"
"forced to drop the knife."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"

msgctxt "0002"

"The top half of the body was wet, yes, but the bottom\n"

"If the sprinklers got the body wet, shouldn't the\n"

msgctxt "0008"

"...while the body was still on fire, I doused it with\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"O-Oh...then I guess the sprinklers r-really didn't do\n"
"it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"So if the sprinklers didn't get the body wet, then the\n"

msgid ""
"...sometime *after* the sprinklers turned on at <CLT 3>7:30\n"
"in the morning<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"

"Which means she must have been killed sometime between\n"

"But Makoto's alibi was only missing from 10 o'clock\n"
"last night to 7:30 this morning, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"So there's no way Makoto could have done it! I guess\n"
"you had an alibi, after all. Good for you!"

msgctxt "0025"

"So she killed her to try and put a stop to all this.\n"
"Isn't that right, Kyoko?"

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"But you made one catastrophic mistake—Mukuro wasn't\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"And as a result, we were forced into another trial,\n"

msgctxt "0039"

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"The sprinklers didn't get the body wet, but that\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Wh-What are you—!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Because you see, there is a way the body could have\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "...Interesting. I'm listening."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"All it would take is covering the body with a <CLT 3>certain\n"

msgctxt "0061"

msgctxt "0066"

"This proves that the killer used the tarp to keep the\n"

msgid ""
"But why would they go to all that effort just to keep\n"

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Most likely so they could cloud the issue of when the\n"

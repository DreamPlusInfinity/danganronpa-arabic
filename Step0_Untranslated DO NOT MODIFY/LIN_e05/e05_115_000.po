msgid ""
"Actually, <CLT 3>one side being clean<CLT> is pretty strange, if\n"
"you think about it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Because...<CLT 3>the blood wasn't dry<CLT> before the body got\n"
"blown up, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Byakuya said it himself—not to touch it or you might\n"
"get some on you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"If you put a tarp on a body in that state, it\n"
"absolutely would have gotten blood on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Well...maybe the culprit washed it, so nobody would\n"
"know they'd used it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"If they had, they would've washed both sides. \n"
"Just washing the one side wouldn't hide anything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "Oh...yeah, true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"More than that, what if the very blood we saw on the\n"
"body was meant as a kind of <CLT 3>camouflage<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Huh...?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The blood was...camouflage?\n"
"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"What if, after the killer used the tarp to avoid the\n"
"sprinklers..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"...they then covered the body in <CLT 3>blood that didn't\n"
"belong to the victim<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Y-You mean...someone else's b-blood? Where would they\n"
"get something l-like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"I know! They coulda grabbed some of the blood packs\n"
"from the <CLT 3>nurse's office<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"That's what Hifumi did, right? When he pretended to be\n"
"dead?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "No, that's not what happened this time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"The killer got the blood from right there in the\n"
"<CLT 3>garden<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"How is that supposed to be connected to the\n"
"acquisition of blood?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Another useless argument..."

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"There's no blood in the garden, right? It had to have\n"
"come from the nurse's office!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "Ooh, or maybe the killer used their own blood!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"If you lost th-that much blood...things probably\n"
"wouldn't end w-well for you...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"

"<CLT 4>They got blood from right there in the garden, right?\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Could it have been...<CLT 3>chicken blood<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "What!? Chicken blood!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"When I checked the chicken coop before the murder,\n"
"there were <CLT 3>five chickens<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "But after the murder, there were only <CLT 3>four<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"S-So you're saying...someone killed a chicken and then\n"
"covered the body with its blood!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Man, that's messed up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Killing a living thing just to do something like that\n"
"is awful! They should have at least eaten it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"I wonder if the killer had to get the blood from the\n"
"scene so they wouldn't be spotted walking around..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Anyway, there's no denying that a chicken went\n"
"missing, which provides a basis for my theory."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Perhaps, but even so...there's one thing that still\n"
"doesn't make sense."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"You said the culprit used the tarp to avoid the water,\n"
"and then covered the body in blood, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"But if that's the case, then the blood should have\n"
"soaked into the ground around the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"But that's not what we saw. Only the <CLT 3>victim's\n"
"clothing<CLT> had blood on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "The ground was completely clean."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "I have to agree, that certainly is strange..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Maybe they didn't apply the blood at the scene. Maybe\n"
"they covered the coat in blood beforehand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "They covered it...beforehand?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"When you discovered the body, was it wearing the coat\n"
"like you normally would?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Um...I think so..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Wait, no... The head was through the neck hole, but\n"
"the arms weren't in the sleeves."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Then that settles it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"...Sorry, I'm having a tough time keeping up. What\n"
"settles what...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Here's what happened—the murder took place <CLT 3>before the\n"
"sprinklers went off<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"But the body didn't get wet, because the killer\n"
"covered it with the tarp."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Then, later, at the same time the killer was gathering\n"
"up the tarp..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"...they pulled the coat over the body. The coat they'd\n"
"already covered in blood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"This series of cover-ups was meant to disguise the\n"
"actual time the murder occurred."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"They wanted us to think the murder happened sometime\n"
"after the sprinklers had gone off, at 7:30."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"If that's actually what took place, it certainly\n"
"becomes possible that the murder happened earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "But...to pull all that off..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"...wouldn't they have had to go back to the garden\n"
"after the sprinklers turned off?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "That actually wouldn't have been all that difficult."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"They already had the coat ready. So they just had to\n"
"grab the tarp and pull the coat over the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "They'd be done in no time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Maybe, but still..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Hina. After you met up with Makoto in the dining hall,\n"
"did you two stay together from that point on?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Oh, no. I headed off to the gym, and Makoto didn't\n"
"show up till later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "Then he had plenty of time to spare, wouldn't you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "Th-That's not—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "Don't bother saying it's not possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Ng...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"I must admit, Kyoko's reasoning is sound. Makoto's\n"

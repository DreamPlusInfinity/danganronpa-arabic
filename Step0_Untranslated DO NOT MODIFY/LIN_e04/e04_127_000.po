"Hina...did you know that Sakura's foot had a certain\n"
"<CLT 3>yellow powder<CLT> stuck to it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "...It did?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"It did. The same yellow powder that had been spilled\n"
"by the shelf in the chem lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "That powder was yellow, wasn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"So the powder we found on Sakura...what else could it\n"
"be but the powder from the chem lab?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "Ah—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Wait wait wait... So what was that powder doing on\n"
"Ogre's foot?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "And it was only on her instep, right!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Sakura must have been standing right there where the\n"
"powder was spilled."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"So the person who spilled the powder by the shelf\n"
"wasn't Hina, but Sakura!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Ah...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"And when Sakura dropped the bottle, she dropped it\n"
"away from where she was actually standing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Which is how she was able to avoid getting it all over\n"
"herself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"But the powder still got scattered around, and some of\n"
"it must have wound up on her instep."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "Is there any problem with my thinking?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"But why did Sakura pay a visit to section C in the\n"
"first place?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"The only explanation is that she was looking for\n"
"poison. After all, that's all that section contained."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "N-No! It was me! I—! The poison—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Because... Because...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Because I killed her!"

msgctxt "0041"

"Sakura went and got the poison. She barricaded\n"

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"She sat there, drank the poison, and breathed her last\n"

msgid ""
"And the empty bottle of poison rolled around the\n"

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"At that point, someone grabbed the bottle and snuck it\n"

msgid "And that was you, wasn't it Hina?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Ng...gaah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "You did it to throw off the investigation, didn't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"When we found her body, you stayed right there near\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"...and because the bottle of poison had rolled near\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "That's when you picked up the bottle, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "You said you were going to go get everyone else..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"...but your real intention was to go to the chem lab\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Once you were at the chem lab, you headed straight to\n"
"the section where the protein powder was kept."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"There, you took the powder and poured it into the\n"

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"When you left the lab, all you had was the empty\n"

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"Thinking about it like that, the footprints make\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"When you were done, you gathered everyone together,\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "Uwah! O-Ogre!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"While everyone else was focused on Sakura, you quietly\n"

msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "Honestly, I should have noticed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "So, Sakura committed suicide."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"In order to hide this fact, Hina undertook a series of\n"
"actions to undermine the investigation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"As long as you could disguise the truth, you didn't\n"
"care if we blamed you for her death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"That's why you didn't bother to get rid of such\n"
"obvious evidence, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"The footprints in the powder, and the bottle of\n"
"poison. Vital pieces of evidence, and yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"So you're saying Hina consciously deceived us to make\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "N-No..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "No! No, no, no, no, no!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "I killed her! I did it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "That's enough, Hina. It's over."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "It's not! Nothing's over!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "It is!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "Actually, no...you're right."

msgctxt "0111"

msgctxt "0002"

"They must have been hiding in there and put their hand\n"

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Does this handprint look familiar, Toko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "N-No, it doesn't!"

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Okay then, let's just compare it to your hand, shall\n"

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Dang, she just straight-up admitted it!"

"After I read S-Sakura's note...I decided to go there\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"I didn't know wh-what she might do if I didn't g-go,\n"
"but I was too scared to f-face her head-on..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"So I f-figured I'd just sneak in first,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Then...did you see what happened? Did you see me hit\n"
"her?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Yes. And I s-saw you write my name. I saw you f-forge\n"
"her dying message!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Well...that's awkward."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "So after he left, I j-jumped out of the locker..."

msgctxt "0027"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "Imbeciles, all of you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "Forget all that. Why did you attack Sakura...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"A-After I put the magazine back, I heard a s-sound\n"
"behind me, like a—like a monster g-growling..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "And when I t-turned around..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"...there was S-Sakura, covered in b-blood...and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"When I saw all that b-blood, I fainted...right there\n"
"in f-front of the magazines."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"I don't remember what h-happened after that. If you\n"

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "...Achoo!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "It WAS your fault, after all!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"My fault, Master's fault! When our faults combine,\n"
"they soar to even greater heights!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Just answer the question. Did you kill Sakura?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Well, to be honest, Miss Morose and me <CLT 3>don't actually\n"
"share our memories<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "So I can't really say what was going on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"But I was just minding my own business, sleeping\n"
"peacefully, when someone shook me awake!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Was it a prince paying me a visit, I wondered. So I\n"
"opened my eyes to see..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "...splatter everywhere! I was NOT prepared for that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "And, well...I guess it took me by surprise!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"I got so startled, I smacked her with the first thing\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Sakura was just worried about you, and you...! You're\n"
"terrible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"No, SHE'S terrible! Thanks to her, I murdered someone\n"
"who wasn't an adorable boy for the first time ever!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"And when it was all over, you collected the pieces of\n"
"the bottle to get rid of the evidence, didn't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"I wasn't about to die for some woman! If I'm gonna\n"
"go down, I want it to be for killing Master!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Just go away and die your meaningless death alone.\n"
"Don't drag me into it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"But I just can't catch a break, ya know? Fate's got it\n"
"out for me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"Cuz normally, Sakura should've been able to dodge my\n"
"attack no problem!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Even as strong as she is, she must have still been\n"
"reeling from Hiro's attack."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "Hey, come on. That's, y'know..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"

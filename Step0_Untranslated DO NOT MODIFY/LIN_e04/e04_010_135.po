msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "All I know is, if she were here, I wouldn't be."

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"The only reason I went out of my way to join the rest\n"

msgctxt "0015"

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "Why...? Why do you hate her so much?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Isn't it obvious? Because this makes things unfair."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Unfair...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"The game should be fair to all players. The existence\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "That's a stupid reason!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Stupid? This is a life-or-death game, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "It IS stupid! You're a stupid idiot!"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Before you get too far into your argument, maybe you\n"

"Why did the mastermind reveal that Sakura was the spy\n"
"to us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"They were getting revenge on her, right? Like Monokuma\n"
"said, \"An eye for an eye.\""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"That may be part of it, but it's not the whole\n"

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"Revealing that fact was also meant to serve as the\n"
"next <CLT 3>motive<CLT> the mastermind wanted to give us."

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"The chaos and confusion born from suspicion...\n"
"The hatred..."

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"In other words, this right here—the fighting, the\n"
"bickering—is the trap the mastermind laid for us."

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Knowing that, will you still stand there and argue\n"

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "Th-That's not what I'm trying to do. It's just..."

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"I mean...how can I get you guys to believe in Sakura\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"If she really can beat the mastermind like she said,\n"
"that'd go a long way in my mind..."

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Idiot! You'd really ask her to do something so\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "It wouldn't matter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"If Sakura were to die, that's one less person for the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "H-Hold on! Byakuya—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"In fact, if she did die, that would settle this entire\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"

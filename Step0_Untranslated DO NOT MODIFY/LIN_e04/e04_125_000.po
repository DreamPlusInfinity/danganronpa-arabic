"You remember how there was <CLT 3>broken glass<CLT> scattered\n"
"all around the room, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Of course! It came from the window you broke to get\n"
"in. What about it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Well, those pieces weren't just scattered *around* the\n"
"protein can..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "We also found pieces <CLT 3>*underneath* the can<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Wh-What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "And this proves it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"It shows that the can must have been put down on the\n"
"floor *after* the window was broken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "So it had to be after we got into the room!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Kh—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "I-I see... So that's your explanation..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Kyoko...earlier, when you asked if anyone had moved\n"
"the can, or tripped over it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"If that were the case, that would explain the can\n"
"being on top of the glass."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"So you asked everyone about it to eliminate that\n"
"possibility right out of the gate..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "And that's made everything clear, hasn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"As long as it was a \"locked room,\" it only contained\n"
"the bottle of poison, and *not* the protein can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"But once the room was opened up, they were switched.\n"
"And as a result..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"...the protein can wound up in the rec room, and the\n"
"bottle of poison returned to the chem lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"If that's all true, then...why did Sakura drink the\n"
"poison?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"I thought we all agreed she was tricked into drinking\n"
"it because of the protein can..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "No...that's not why..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"The only explanation is...she drank it from its\n"
"original bottle, knowing exactly what it was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Precisely. She was alone in a locked room. All she had\n"
"was the poison. What other possibility is there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "You're saying she drank it...knowing what it was?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Such a ridiculous fiction is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "...exactly what happened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Then tell us already...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "Er, sorry. Please, tell us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Before we get to that, we need to clarify one other\n"
"thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"We need to establish who exactly got the poison from\n"
"the chem lab and took it to the rec room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"...It was Hina, right? She took it and gave it to\n"
"Ogre."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "What do you think, Makoto?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "Sakura"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Hina"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "That's right I killed Sakura! Me! I'm the blackened!"

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"What does it matter who got what from where and took\n"
"it wherever!?"

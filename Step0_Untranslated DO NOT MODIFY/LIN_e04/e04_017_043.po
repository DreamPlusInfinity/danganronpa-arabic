msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"And that door had been jammed shut with the chair from\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "S-Sure, if you don't mind..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"When you break down this kind of murder mystery, there\n"
"are <CLT 3>four basic types<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"The first type is when <CLT 3>the locked room is created\n"
"after the actual crime is committed<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"This simply means that the killer commits his crime,\n"
"then through some special method seals the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"This mainly involves some sort of trick involving the\n"
"\"locking\" of the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Basic approaches include using a string, or simple\n"
"mechanism. There are a number of variations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So for that, all we'd have to do is check the door to\n"
"see if that's what it was, right?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"The second type is when <CLT 3>the locked room already\n"
"exists before the crime is committed<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Oh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Basically, the killer uses a special contraption or\n"
"tool from outside to target the victim inside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"You push a switch and it fires a handgun, you shoot an\n"
"arrow through a gap in the door, something like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "But in this case, that doesn't seem to fit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"There are no guns or arrows in the school, and the\n"
"door doesn't have any gap that would allow it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Yeah, I think we can probably cross that one off the\n"
"list...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"The third type is when <CLT 3>the killer stays in the room\n"
"until it's opened up<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "What do you mean by that...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"They stay hidden, and when the door is opened, they\n"
"use the confusion to blend in with the group."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"They pretend they showed up along with everyone else,\n"
"and that's that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>That sounds like it could have been\n"
"possible...maybe...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"And the fourth and final type is when <CLT 3>it wasn't\n"
"actually a locked room at all<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Not a locked room...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"By that I mean, there actually is an alternate escape\n"
"route somewhere within the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"You see this a lot in novels and things, but in\n"
"reality it's generally not possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Then you think we can cross that one off, too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "I believe so, yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"So, when it comes to locked room mysteries, those are\n"
"the basics."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "So there are four possibilities..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Then...Kyoko, which of those four choices seems the\n"
"most likely in this case?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"That's a good question. Answering that should be our\n"
"primary focus during this trial."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "But right now...I can't really say."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "I see..."

"<CLT 4>For Sakura, if nothing else...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Yeah, she's not the type who would go down without a\n"

msgid ""
"She was the <CLT 3>Ultimate Martial Artist<CLT>, strong in body,\n"

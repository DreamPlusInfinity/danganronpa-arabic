msgctxt "0121"

msgctxt "0131"

msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0136"

"Th-That doesn't matter! Just cuz I'm guilty, that\n"

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"No, it doesn't. But the fact that you won't tell us\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"Surely you're not—do you honestly think Hina didn't\n"
"actually kill her?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid "And if I do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"Impossible. She switched out the mixtures. She's the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid "Are you sure about that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid ""
"Even ignoring the fact that I don't want to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid "What doesn't fit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid ""
"I mean...why would someone leave such a clear clue\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid "It's too...obvious. Too easy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid ""
"He's right. It makes it look like you wanted\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid "Th-That was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid ""
"I was just...nervous! So I-I didn't notice I'd\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"
msgid "...You didn't notice?"

msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0154"

msgctxt "0157"

msgctxt "0158"

msgctxt "0159"
msgid ""
"There's nobody else to suspect. Nobody else could have\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0160"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0161"
msgid "W-Well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0162"
msgid "Right away I went to section C, and got the poison."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0163"
msgid ""
"And is that when you spilled the powder in front of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0164"
msgid ""
"Y-Yeah...when I opened the bottle, I dropped it like\n"
"an idiot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0165"
msgid "I see. Okay then, go on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0166"
msgid ""
"So then I moved to section A and got the protein\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0167"
msgid "Once I was done with that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0168"
msgid ""
"...I took the protein can that had the poison in it\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0169"
msgid ""
"But I accidentally put the bottle filled with protein\n"
"powder back on the wrong shelf."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0170"

"And because of that, everything I did got found out.\n"

msgctxt "0171"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0172"
msgid "That story you just told..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0173"
msgid ""
"First you went to section C to get the poison, then\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0174"

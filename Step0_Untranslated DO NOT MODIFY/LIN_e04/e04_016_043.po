msgctxt "0098"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "I won't let someone like that come anywhere near her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"Don't be stupid. Our lives are in just as much danger\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "How about a compromise?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "I won't ask you to let all of us in. Just let me."

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"I'd rather spend my time coming up with another\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "And you, Hiro? Do you really object?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"I-If you're gonna go that far, what can I do? I mean,\n"
"I don't have anything to hide, so why should I care?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "Then it's decided."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "Nothing's decided!"

msgctxt "0115"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"I saw that someone had taken something from the poison\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "So I ran back to the rec room as fast as I could."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "And yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid "You all blamed her..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"I tried to protect her, and I suffered for it. And\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "And I didn't even realize it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "Hina..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "We killed her... All of us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "People like us shouldn't be allowed to live!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "And that's why you tried to lead us astray."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"You did your best to make us arrive at the wrong\n"
"conclusion during the class trial."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"Sakura died hating all of us. I wanted to free her of\n"
"her regrets."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"But even that got found out. In the end, I wasn't able\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "I could never face her after this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"I'm sorry to interrupt right when you're about to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"...it's just taking so long, long, long, LONG! I'm\n"
"about to fall asleep over here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"I mean, do you really think you have any idea what\n"
"Sakura was actually thinking when she died?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "What did you say...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"Everything you just said is nothing but your\n"
"interpretation, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "Your own opinion on what her suicide note meant?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"O-Of course I know what she was thinking! Cuz her and\n"
"me—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid "Well, what I'm really trying to say is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid "...don't you think the entire foundation is shaky?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid "What if it was really...like this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid "What...is that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid "Isn't it obvious?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid "A <CLT 3>suicide note<CLT>. *Sakura's* suicide note."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid "Wh-What? But Hina already..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid "Oh, I wrote that one. It was all me, baby."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"This is the one Sakura addressed to Hina and put in\n"
"her room!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid "What? Then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid "You...lied to me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"Oh, don't say \"lie\"! It makes it sound so dirty! I\n"
"just thought I'd liven things up a bit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid ""
"I can't help it if you totally took my little\n"
"scribbles at face value."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid "It didn't even have Sakura's signature on it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid "You filthy little...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid "I'm not filthy! I didn't do anything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"Did I falsify evidence? Did I affect the outcome of\n"
"the class trial?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid ""
"The case played out between you and you alone. You\n"
"were the ones jerking each other around."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"Heck, even if the will *had* factored in, it still\n"
"woulda been between you guys."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid ""
"So what's the problem!? This is all part of the\n"
"production process! Okay, and...scene! Cut!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid ""
"So then, what did she write in her *real* suicide\n"
"note?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid ""
"I'm glad you asked! For your benefit, I shall read it\n"
"using my melodic, angelic, harmonic narrator voice!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid ""
"But you know...haven't you ever been curious about the\n"
"whole \"suicide note\" thing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid ""
"Who came up with the idea of leaving a note when you\n"
"kill yourself in the first place?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid ""
"And isn't it just so unfortunate? Killing yourself is\n"
"just so final, ya know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid ""
"You can never hear the rest of their story. The truth\n"
"is lost in darkness. Gives me the willies...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid "Could you get on with it, please?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"
msgid ""
"Okay, okay, jeez! Talk about a buzzkill... Alright,\n"
"here we go."

msgctxt "0150"

"<CLT 23>My good friend Hina. There's something I have to tell\n"

msgctxt "0155"
msgid ""
"It was our first night in this strange school that the\n"
"mastermind came to see me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0156"
msgid ""
"You see, the mastermind took control of <CLT 3>my family's\n"
"dojo<CLT>, and demanded I become their tool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0157"
msgid ""
"You might not see the importance of a dojo, but my\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0158"
msgid ""
"I couldn't let it be destroyed under my watch. So even\n"
"if it meant my own life, I had to protect it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0159"
msgid "That's how I saw things..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0160"
msgid "However, that was my <CLT 3>greatest weakness<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0161"
msgid ""
"And because of that, I made the mistake of giving in\n"
"to the mastermind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0162"
msgid ""
"And what the mastermind wanted from me was nothing\n"
"less...than <CLT 3>murder<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0163"
msgid ""
"They were probably worried that until the first murder\n"
"had happened, nothing would move forward."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0164"
msgid ""
"But what neither the mastermind nor I expected...was\n"
"the incident involving Sayaka."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0165"
msgid "At that point, the plan changed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0166"
msgid ""
"The mastermind told me to hold off—to wait until we\n"

msgctxt "0167"
msgid "However, as I lived here with all of you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0168"
msgid "As I lived here with Hina..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0169"
msgid "...my resolve began to weaken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0170"
msgid ""
"Watching everyone fight with such despair, trying so\n"
"desperately to stay alive..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0171"
msgid ""
"...I saw the weakness in my own heart, the mistake of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0172"
msgid "And more than anything..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0173"
msgid ""
"...I cannot betray those who would call me <CLT 3>their\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0174"
msgid "That's how I came to feel."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0175"
msgid "So that's why Sakura..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0176"
msgid "I've made a decision..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0177"
msgid ""
"I will no longer retreat, no longer compromise, no\n"

msgctxt "0178"
msgid "I've made my decision!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0179"
msgid "I'm going...to resist you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0180"
msgid ""
"Of course, because of that I decided to reveal her\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0181"
msgid ""
"Her decision to stay true to all of you led directly\n"
"to all of you hating her for it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0182"
msgid ""
"Ironic, isn't it!? Or maybe oxymoronic? Or just\n"
"moronic...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0183"
msgid ""
"Of course, I understand if you all hate me. All of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0184"
msgid ""
"I'm perfectly willing to accept whatever attack you\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0185"
msgid ""
"So this is my atonement for betraying you. That's what\n"

msgctxt "0186"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0187"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0189"

msgctxt "0190"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0191"
msgid "Of course, I'm still responsible for that, as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0192"
msgid ""
"I have an obligation to get this situation under\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0193"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0194"
msgid "I will do as I was told, and <CLT 3>commit murder<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0195"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0196"

msgctxt "0197"
msgid ""
"If the mastermind demands that I kill someone, then\n"

msgctxt "0199"
msgid ""
"When I die, the source of conflict among you all dies\n"

msgctxt "0200"

msgctxt "0203"

msgctxt "0206"
msgid ""
"She wanted to...stop us from fighting? To <CLT 3>protect\n"

msgctxt "0207"

msgctxt "0208"
msgid "Quite the opposite, in fact..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0209"
msgid "She was <CLT 3>strong<CLT>. *Too* strong."

msgctxt "0210"
msgid "That's why she killed herself."

msgctxt "0211"

msgctxt "0212"

msgctxt "0215"
msgid "Finally...Hina, I want to apologize to you especially."

msgctxt "0216"

msgctxt "0218"

"Hiro...when we were talking before, you dropped a\n"
"<CLT 3>small piece of paper<CLT>, remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "It was <CLT 3>white with red polka dots<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Wh-What's that got to do with anything!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Red polka dots...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"That's gotta be the <CLT 3>wrapper from the candy<CLT> I gave\n"
"Sakura!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "N-No, it's...it's, um..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Ever since we got into the warehouse, I totally\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"So there's no way a single one of them was left in the\n"
"warehouse!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"In that case, Hiro...where *did* you get that piece of\n"
"candy?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "From Sakura! It's the only explanation!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "U-Umm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "W-Well, I mean...yeah, sure I got it from her, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"But she gave it to me forever ago! It doesn't have\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "When? When did she give it to you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"The last time you saw Sakura was...when Hina had to go\n"
"to the nurse's office, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "Y-Yeah, so I musta got it...some time before then."

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "When Sakura got that candy"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Sakura loved candy too much to share"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Sakura loved candy more than life itself! No way would\n"
"she have given a piece to Hiro!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"So Hiro must have stolen it off of her corpse after\n"
"she was dead!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"In other words, *after* the incident in the nurse's\n"
"office!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "Sakura never told me she liked candy that much!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"

msgctxt "0026"

"Y-Yeah! I got my piece from Hina, too! That's the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"And that's where the wrapper came from! From when Hina\n"
"gave me a piece that one time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Huh? What...one time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But...what Hiro said can't be right.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0039"

"<CLT 4>And the reason I know that is...\n"

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Hina didn't actually give Sakura the candy till <CLT 3>after\n"
"she left the nurse's office<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0054"

msgctxt "0056"

"It was her \"<CLT 3>dying message<CLT>\"! Just like what you guys\n"

msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "W-Well, when we found Ogre's body. Duh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"But if you recall, Hina was very adamant about keeping\n"
"you away from the scene of the crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"

"So it's hard to believe that's when you actually saw\n"

"<CLT 4>Huh? Hold on...\n"

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"How were you able to spot it, despite it being so high\n"
"up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"B-Because my eyes are, like...super long! What's so\n"
"strange about that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Your eyes are...long? What does that mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Actually, now that I think about it...I'm pretty sure\n"
"the magazine wasn't above the shelf, anyway..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "Sorry about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0083"

"<CLT 4>So the dying message was inside the magazine, and the\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Hiro was barred from entering the crime scene, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "So when could he have seen the dying message?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"If he was going to find it, the only time he could\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0089"

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"Kyoko, you found the magazine on the <CLT 3>magazine shelf<CLT>,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"That's right. Looking through the shelf, I found the\n"
"magazine with the dying message on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"I found it right there at the scene of the crime,\n"
"<CLT 3>after we'd started the investigation<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"If that's true, then what Hiro just said doesn't\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "D-Doesn't make sense...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"What doesn't make sense!? Everything I said makes\n"

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>No, there's an obvious problem with what Hiro said\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There's definitely something strange about it!\n"
"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0098"

"<CLT 4>Kyoko found the dying message during the\n"

msgctxt "0001"
msgid "I've got it! <CLT 3>Taka's wristwatch<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"See? Look. It broke with the hands pointing <CLT 3>just past\n"
"6 o'clock<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"It must have gotten broken when he was attacked by the\n"
"killer. Because as of last night..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Hey! You! How long were you gonna keep us waiting!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Taka's irritated voice pierced the air as he stared\n"
"pointedly at his wristwatch.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"It's almost 10 o'clock, you know that!? Bedtime for\n"
"all the little boys and girls!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"So if it wasn't broken after 6 last night, then he\n"
"must have been attacked around <CLT 3>6 this morning<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "And that would be his official time of death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"But if that's true, then he was killed well before\n"
"Hifumi..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"And before Celeste was attacked this morning, which\n"
"happened around 7."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"That's right. Taka was killed <CLT 3>before<CLT> any of the\n"
"other incidents took place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "That simple fact slipped past all of us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"We made the <CLT 3>wrong assumption<CLT> about the order of\n"
"events all because of those Justice Hammers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"That's exactly why the culprit wrote the numbers on\n"
"each hammer, and had them increase in size."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"That way, when we saw how they were used in each\n"
"incident, we'd easily make that wrong assumption."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"Now, if Taka *was* killed around 6, then <CLT 3>everyone's\n"
"alibis<CLT> for his murder go out the window."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Because when he was killed, we hadn't met up in the\n"
"dining hall yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "That may be true in the case of Taka's murder..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"...but <CLT 3>all of our alibis still hold true<CLT> for\n"
"Hifumi's death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "That's right... With him at least, we're all safe..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Ungyaaaaaahhh!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "Huh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Wh-What was that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "That came from downstairs! It must have been..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Hifumi! He's in the nurse's office!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "This is bad! Come on, we have to go back!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"When we heard Hifumi screaming, we were all together.\n"
"Except for Hiro and Kyoko..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Then we all ran down to the nurse's office, and that's\n"
"where we found his body..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "That's totally true! We're all in the clear!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Oh, I know! They must've recorded him screaming on a\n"
"tape or something, then played it later on!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "If that's true, where's the tape?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "I dunno."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Don't just go makin' stuff up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Anyway, we all have rock-solid alibis for when we\n"
"heard Hifumi scream."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Since all of us were there together, clearly none of\n"
"us could have killed him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"And it does not stop there. There was also the moment\n"
"when we discovered his body had disappeared..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "When his body vanished from the nurse's office..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"...Hina and I were in the bathroom together, while\n"
"everyone else was in the equipment room, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"And then there's the disappearance of Taka's body from\n"
"the equipment room..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"At that time, we were all gathered together in the\n"
"nurse's office because of Hifumi going missing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Well, don't forget, I was passed out in the equipment\n"
"room the whole time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Wait, then what if Genocide Jill did it!? She could've\n"
"dragged Taka's body out of there right then!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Even if she could pull that off, there's no way she\n"
"could have done the same with Hifumi's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Because, as we just established, she was passed out in\n"
"the equipment room when his body disappeared."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Besides, I didn't do either of 'em anyway!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"In other words, it is impossible that any of us could\n"
"have killed Hifumi, or moved either of their bodies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"On the other hand, <CLT 3>Hiro<CLT> and <CLT 3>Kyoko<CLT> had disappeared.\n"
"So they most certainly could have done those things."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Hmm... So what now, Kyoko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"For now, we can't get fixated on who did it, or we'll\n"
"just keep going around in circles."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"So instead of \"<CLT 3>who<CLT>\" I propose we start talking about\n"
"\"<CLT 3>how<CLT>\"..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"In particular, I think we need to figure out how\n"
"Hifumi's body got moved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"That's true. We searched everywhere, but we couldn't\n"
"figure out how to explain his body disappearing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "And according to what Celeste said..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"We could not have been gone for more than a minute or\n"
"two, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"So then, the killer was able to get in and move\n"
"Hifumi's body in that short amount of time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "It would seem so..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"His body apparently disappeared in the one minute her\n"
"and Hina took their eyes off of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"But to carry that much weight from the 1st floor up to\n"
"the 3rd, in that short amount of time..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "...Oh man, yeah! There's no way! It'd be impossible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"Well, what if I told you there was a <CLT 3>way<CLT> to make the\n"
"impossible possible?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "What? How!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "If the dead body...were to move itself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "Th-The dead body m-moved on its own!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "N-N-N-No! Not another gh-gh-gh-ghooooossst!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"I don't think it has anything to do with the occult. I\n"
"think what she's implying is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"...we thought Hifumi was dead, but perhaps in reality\n"
"he was still alive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "He was...alive!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"Are you saying Hifumi wasn't carried out of the\n"
"nurse's office, but simply walked out on his own?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "But I mean...we found his body! He was dead!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "Perhaps he was simply *playing* dead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "That... It isn't possible...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The idea that Hifumi was still alive...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Is it really possible?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

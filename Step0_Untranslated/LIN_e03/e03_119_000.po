"The murder weapon wasn't a Justice Hammer at all. No,\n"
"it was something <CLT 3>completely different<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "But...seriously? A different weapon?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Specifically, <CLT 3>a hammer from the repository<CLT>. The\n"
"killer could have easily used that to kill Hifumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Now, all the hammers in the repository were covered in\n"
"flecks of grit and debris..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"...but for some reason, one of them had been <CLT 3>scrubbed\n"
"clean<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"And the reason it had been scrubbed clean was most\n"
"likely because it was used to commit murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"If the hammer got covered in Hifumi's blood, of course\n"
"they'd have to clean it off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"I'd also like to point out that the repository has all\n"
"kinds of hammers—big ones, small ones..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "...and even some <CLT 3>flat, mallet-like<CLT> ones."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"I think whoever made the Justice Hammers used those as\n"
"a basis for their design."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"If that's true, that would explain the Monokuma File's\n"
"note about the wounds being similar..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"So Hifumi moved Taka's body to the repository, where\n"
"someone then used a hammer to kill *him*."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"And whoever did that is the <CLT 3>true killer<CLT>—the one\n"
"Hifumi was working with...and the one who betrayed him...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Hold on a moment. I still think it's strange to assume\n"
"someone was <CLT 3>working together<CLT> with him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"The way the \"graduation\" rule works, there is no\n"
"benefit to helping someone else carry out a murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"So the idea that anyone would work together like that\n"
"is simply ludicrous. We talked about this, did we not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>We did talk about how there wouldn't be any reason for\n"
"anyone to work together...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>At least, that's what we thought at first. But...\n"
"<CLT>"

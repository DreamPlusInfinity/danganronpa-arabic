"In fact, there was one clear <CLT 3>difference<CLT> between\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "His <CLT 3>glasses<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"

"That fact alone proves that he was only playing dead\n"

"When we found Hifumi in the nurse's office, his\n"

msgctxt "0006"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "...they were spotless."

"And! I found the item he used to wipe them clean in\n"

msgctxt "0011"

"You said you found it in the trash can in the nurse's\n"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0019"

msgctxt "0023"

msgctxt "0024"

"<CLT 4>The evidence I found in the trash can in the nurse's\n"
"office was...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"It was a <CLT 3>glasses cleaning cloth<CLT> featuring a certain\n"
"cartoon mascot!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"One look at the <CLT 3>bloodstain<CLT> on the cloth should make\n"
"things clear."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"This piece of cloth was used to wipe Hifumi's glasses\n"
"clean."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"And the <CLT 3>mascot<CLT> on the cloth is the same one that's\n"
"on the digital camera, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"And whose digital camera was it? Hifumi's, of\n"
"course..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"The character was...Princess Piggles, from \"Demon\n"
"Angel☆Pretty Pudgy Princess\" I think..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"I highly doubt anyone but Hifumi would have brought\n"
"something like this to school..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"I see your point. And the only people here who wear\n"
"glasses are..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"I wouldn't be caught dead using a tacky piece of\n"
"garbage like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "A few tissues is all I need to keep my glasses clean!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "...Then there's no question—it belonged to Hifumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "Mm, mm... So what you're saying is...what exactly?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"What I'm saying is, the blood on his glasses was wiped\n"
"away using his own glasses cleaning cloth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Even if that is true, it does not mean he wiped the\n"
"blood off himself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"But who would benefit from a clean pair of glasses,\n"
"other than the glasses' owner?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "That's a good point..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Then it must've been him...right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"So let's assume that Hifumi was still alive in the\n"
"nurse's office."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"He pretends to be dead, then when he's alone, he wipes\n"
"his glasses clean so he can see..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Then he stands up and walks out on his own two feet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"And with that, the impossible task of moving his\n"
"copious corpse...becomes possible, wouldn't you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "But then, if he was just pretending to be dead..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"...what was with all that blood? Was it paint or\n"
"somethin'?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"The fridge in the nurse's office contains packs of\n"
"blood for emergencies. He probably used one of those."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"He figured if he was gonna play dead, he should go\n"
"all-out! So he just dumped it everywhere!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"But he got crazy with it, and had to wipe his glasses\n"
"off when he was done! God, what an idiot!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"And if Hifumi was still alive at that point, the\n"
"disappearance of Taka's body is easily explained."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"It should be perfectly obvious who must have moved\n"
"Taka's corpse..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Hifumi"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Sakura"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Taka...was dead for sure. So there's no way he moved\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Wait...I got it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"It was a ghost! The ghost of Chihiro, or maybe Sayaka!\n"
"They moved Taka's body...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Things are gonna go from bad to worse if I don't hurry\n"
"up and explain this...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There was someone who we thought was dead but was\n"

"<CLT>"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "It could only have been <CLT 3>Hifumi<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"While we were all gathered in the nurse's office, he\n"
"went to the equipment room and took Taka's body..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"That also explains how the door to the repository got\n"
"locked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "The door was locked?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"Well, after the bodies disappeared, we all went\n"
"looking for them, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "So me and Sakura headed for the repository."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "But when we got there, the door was locked!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"And the repository door can only be locked from the\n"
"inside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Which means, when Hina and Sakura got to the\n"
"repository, someone was already inside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"And it could only have been Hifumi, who'd just\n"
"finished stashing Taka's body there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"He convinced us all he was dead, and when he saw his\n"
"chance, he dragged Taka's body to the repository."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"So, Hifumi wasn't just another victim in this case—he\n"
"was one of the <CLT 3>assailants<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "B-But...that means he took part in the murders...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "I...I just can't believe it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"If you're having trouble, would you like me to show\n"
"you one more piece of evidence?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Th-There's more!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"Oh, absolutely. The single biggest fact pointing to\n"
"his involvement has yet to be revealed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"You know what I'm talking about, right Makoto? The\n"
"<CLT 3>item<CLT> he took off of Taka's lifeless body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"I'm talking about what Hifumi *stole* from Taka.\n"
"There's no point identifying what Taka had on him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"

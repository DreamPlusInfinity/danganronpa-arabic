msgctxt "0001"
msgid "No, there absolutely is a connection!"

msgctxt "0002"

"The note said to meet at <CLT 3>6 a.m.<CLT>, which is the same\n"
"time Taka was murdered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "We've already proven that using his <CLT 3>wristwatch<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "But there's more—look where the note says to <CLT 3>meet<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "The equipment room, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "Which is where Taka was killed. I see..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"So, Taka was murdered at both the time and place\n"
"written in the note."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"I think that should be plenty to show that this note\n"
"was definitely meant for Taka!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Hmm...well, when you put it like that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "No further objections! Kyeeehahahaha!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Then someone used that note to trick Taka, just the\n"
"same as me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Gh—! The culprit really is a cold-blooded monster!\n"
"Telling people they'd found a way out...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"But if they gave the note to Taka...what was Hifumi\n"
"doing with it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "Stuffed down his pants, no less!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"Most likely, Hifumi stole it off Taka's corpse after\n"
"he died."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Huh? He stole it...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Where's your proof? Go ahead, show us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Come on, are you kidding? Yes, that's something that\n"
"he had, I don't deny it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "What I'm asking for is proof that he *stole* it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Is that the proof? How come?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "U-Ummm...because..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Sorry Makoto, I think you're wrong. I bet the proof is\n"
"in his pants! Everything's in the pants!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "Hina...I wouldn't go around saying that too much..."

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"Now's no time to get confused, Makoto. It's up to you\n"
"to open up a new path here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"

msgctxt "0029"

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"When I searched Taka's body, I saw that his lifeless\n"
"hand was gripping a <CLT 3>small scrap of paper<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"If I'm right about this, the <CLT 3>sheet of paper<CLT> this\n"
"piece came from is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"I knew it! It <CLT 3>fits perfectly<CLT> with the note we found\n"
"hidden on Hifumi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Then Taka's scrap and Hifumi's note..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "Yup. They're from the same piece of paper."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Hifumi had the note meant for Taka, while Taka's\n"
"corpse still grasped a small piece of that note..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "There's only one way to explain it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"Taka died clutching the note. Hifumi tried to free the\n"
"note from his death grip..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "...leaving behind only one small scrap."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Did I get all that right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "That means Hifumi knew the note was important..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Exactly. Which proves that he was an accomplice in the\n"
"murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Whoa...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Yeah, after seeing all this, Hifumi was super involved\n"
"in this whole thing for sure!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "In fact..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"He was behind the whole thing! In FACT, he's still\n"
"alive!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "...Sorry, no."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"When we found him in the repository, Hifumi was truly\n"
"and completely dead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "The second body discovery announcement proves that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "So then...who killed Hifumi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "Whoever did is the mastermind...the <CLT 3>true killer<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"He was killed in the <CLT 3>repository<CLT>, so he must have\n"
"been killed not long after transporting Taka's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"So he must have been killed after Taka's body vanished\n"
"but before we found both bodies in the repository..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"During that time, we'd all split up and were searching\n"
"for Taka's missing body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"In other words, during that time...none of us have\n"
"alibis."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Wait, but me and Sakura were together!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Stop trying to steal the spotlight, ya stupid walrus!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "Who are you callin' a walrus!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Anyway, when they were killed bothers me too, but\n"
"there's something that's been bothering me even more!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "And what might that be?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "The <CLT 3>weapon<CLT> they used to kill Hifumi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "The weapon...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "Yeah, cuz I mean...according to the Monokuma File..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"The way Taka and Hifumi were killed was almost the\n"
"same, with them having similar fractures and all..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"But Justice Hammer 3 and 4 were still laying around in\n"
"the nurse's office and equipment room, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "So if Hifumi was killed in the repository..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"...the culprit woulda had to grab one of the hammers,\n"
"kill Hifumi..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "...then <CLT 3>put the hammer back<CLT> where they found it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "But wouldn't that be seriously risky for 'em?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"...I'm surprised. It seems there's some semblance of a\n"
"brain knocking around that skull of yours, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "Hell yeah, it's packed in there good and tight!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "He's right, though. I don't understand it, either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"The Monokuma File makes it clear that they were killed\n"
"using similar instruments..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"But if the hammers were already laying around those\n"
"other rooms..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"So the question is, how could the culprit have gotten\n"
"their hands on either of the hammers?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "Personally, I haven't a clue."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"So which hammer was used to attack Celeste? Number one\n"
"or number two!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Those were accounted for in other rooms, too. And I\n"
"don't think either one is big enough to kill someone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Um...then, uhh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "...Is it not possible they used a different weapon?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"I don't think it *is* possible! They were both killed\n"
"with the same kinda thing, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "So then, <CLT 3>what was used<CLT> to kill Hifumi...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The weapon that was actually used to kill Hifumi...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The whole picture surrounding this case won't become\n"
"clear until we figure that out.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Somehow, I have to find the truth!\n"
"<CLT>"

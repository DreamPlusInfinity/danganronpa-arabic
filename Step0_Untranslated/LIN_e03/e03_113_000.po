msgctxt "0001"
msgid ""
"Was the <CLT 3>body discovery announcement<CLT> that was made\n"
"really intended for <CLT 3>Hifumi<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Of course it was. The announcement played right after\n"
"we discovered his body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Maybe, but that was also the same time that Taka's\n"
"body was found."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"That's right. It wasn't long after finding his body\n"
"that we heard the announcement."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"So there's a good chance we've made a mistake in there\n"
"somewhere."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"I think we've confused whether the announcement was\n"
"for Hifumi or Taka."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"First of all, if two bodies had been found, there\n"
"really should have been two announcements."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Maybe Monokuma simply got lazy and rolled them\n"
"together into one..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "What do you say, Monokuma? Any comment?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Well, it's a very sensitive issue, so I can't go into\n"
"too much detail..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"But what I *can* say about the body discovery\n"
"announcement is that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"...it's only broadcast when three or more people find\n"
"a dead body for the first time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"That didn't answer our question, man! We're asking if\n"
"you're a lazy bum!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "No, actually, that was plenty."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"He said it's only broadcast when a body is discovered\n"
"\"<CLT 3>for the first time<CLT>.\" Which means..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"...even if we find the same body again later, he won't\n"
"make the announcement again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"If that's true, then why was the announcement made\n"
"again later on?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Huh? Later on!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Exactly. We heard the body discovery announcement\n"
"twice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "When both bodies were rediscovered"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "Just after Hifumi came back to life"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Are you really sure about that? Think hard and try to\n"
"remember..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Now that you mention it...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The second announcement came right after Hifumi woke\n"
"up for the last time, I think...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "When Toko was found unconscious"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"I was just passed out! Why would the announcement play\n"
"for that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Actually, that's true. I feel like it was way later...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"What's wrong? Have you forgotten how to talk? Then\n"
"shall I answer instead?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"Umm...I'm sure I was in the repository when I heard\n"
"it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The second body discovery announcement...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The first time it played was when we found each body\n"
"in the nurse's office and the equipment room...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>And the second time was when...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"We heard it a second time in the repository <CLT 3>when we\n"
"rediscovered the two bodies<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"<CLT 23>*Ding dong, ding dong*\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "A body has been discovered!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"After a certain amount of time, which you may use\n"
"however you like, the class trial will begin!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"It didn't seem weird at the time...but it\n"
"<CLT 3>contradicts<CLT> what Monokuma just told us, doesn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Exactly. If we were actually \"re\"discovering both\n"
"bodies, the announcement shouldn't have played."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Then in reality..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"When the two dead bodies were rediscovered, one of\n"
"them was actually..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "...being <CLT 3>discovered for the first time<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"So when we found Hifumi the first time in the nurse's\n"
"office, he wasn't actually dead yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Meaning he wasn't actually found dead until we came\n"
"upon him in the repository."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "And that's just part of it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"There's one other thing that leads me to believe he\n"
"was still alive in the nurse's office..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "Oh! Oh! I know! I know!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Because he was super good at playing dead!\n"
"Badda-bing badda-boom!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "That is the worst logic I have ever heard..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"But honestly, I do not think there's anything that\n"
"can prove he was still alive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Okay then, let's take another look at the events\n"
"surrounding the discovery of his body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Then it should become clear whether he was really\n"
"alive or not."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "This whole thing is pointless..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There has to be proof that shows Hifumi was still\n"
"alive. I have to find it and show it to everyone!\n"

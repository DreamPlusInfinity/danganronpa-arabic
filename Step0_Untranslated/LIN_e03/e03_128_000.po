"Before anything, the killer persuaded someone to help\n"
"carry out the murder. And that person was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"...<CLT 3>Hifumi<CLT>. With an <CLT 3>accomplice<CLT>, the killer was able\n"
"to execute a number of otherwise impossible schemes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"First, they convinced someone to meet them in the <CLT 3>rec\n"
"room<CLT> last night at <CLT 3>one in the morning<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "That \"someone\" they met with was <CLT 3>Hiro<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"The murderous duo intended to pass Hiro off as the\n"
"prime suspect. So when they met up with him..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"...they drugged him, knocked him out, and stuffed him\n"
"into the <CLT 3>Robo Justice suit<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Next, Hifumi positioned himself to make it look like\n"
"Robo Justice was attacking him..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"...while the killer <CLT 3>used a digital camera to take\n"
"pictures<CLT> of the \"assault.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"They did all this just to create evidence that would\n"
"put the suspicion on Hiro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"When they were done with him, they shoved him, still\n"
"unconscious, into the pool room locker."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"And then finally, at 6 a.m., they moved into the\n"
"\"murder\" phase of their plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "They called <CLT 3>Taka<CLT> to the <CLT 3>equipment room<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"And that's where Hifumi killed him, making it the\n"
"scene of the first murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"The murder weapon was \"<CLT 3>Justice Hammer 4<CLT>,\" which was\n"
"left there in the equipment room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"The reason hammer number 4 was used was to create\n"
"confusion about the order of the crimes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "So, next they falsified two more assault incidents."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"For these attacks, the killers pretended to be the\n"
"victims, to solidify Robo Justice as the suspect..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"The first fake incident was the <CLT 3>attack in the rec\n"
"room<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"There, the killers wanted us to see <CLT 3>Justice Hammer 1<CLT>\n"
"and the <CLT 3>Robo Justice pictures<CLT> they'd taken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"They wanted to make sure we bought the \"surprise\n"
"attack\" story."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"The second fake incident was the <CLT 3>attack in the\n"
"library<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"This time, they planted <CLT 3>Justice Hammer 2<CLT> and <CLT 3>an\n"
"\"injured\" Hifumi<CLT> to sell us that story."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"With these two incidents, the killers were able to\n"
"create a certain preconception in our minds..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"That the suspect was increasing the size of the\n"
"hammers and attacking people in order as they did."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"We fell right into their trap and started looking for\n"
"the suspect based on that, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"...while we did that, we left Hifumi alone in the\n"
"<CLT 3>nurse's office<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "This was exactly what Hifumi was hoping for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"He took a <CLT 3>blood packet<CLT> from the refrigerator and\n"
"<CLT 3>Justice Hammer 3<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"...and turned the room into a crime scene, in which he\n"
"himself had apparently been brutally murdered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"He let out a scream to draw us back, and when we\n"
"returned, that's what we found."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Meanwhile, the other group that had been out searching\n"
"found Taka's body at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"So when we heard the <CLT 3>body discovery announcement<CLT>, we\n"
"naturally assumed it was for Hifumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"We left the nurse's office, and Hifumi once again took\n"
"advantage of the situation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "He simply got up and made his escape..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"When we learned his body had disappeared, we all\n"
"rushed back to the nurse's office."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"And once again, Hifumi had the chance he was waiting\n"
"for. This time, he snuck into the equipment room..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"He wrapped Taka's body in a <CLT 3>tarp<CLT> and used the\n"
"<CLT 3>dolly<CLT> to move it all the way down to the <CLT 3>repository<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "That explains how <CLT 3>each of the bodies disappeared<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"But even Hifumi didn't know what the true killer had\n"
"in mind for their final act..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Their plan all along was to <CLT 3>kill Hifumi<CLT> and get rid\n"
"of the one person who could betray them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"And they did it using <CLT 3>an ordinary, everyday hammer\n"
"from the repository<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"That should cover everything that happened in this\n"
"case. And the villain behind it all is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "<CLT 3>Celeste<CLT>! Sorry, you lose!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>No, I didn't lay out my reasoning right! I need to\n"

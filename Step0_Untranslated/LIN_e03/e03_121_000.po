"Since there were <CLT 3>two murders<CLT>, it's at least\n"
"plausible that more than one person was involved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "...What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"If there'd only been one murder, then yes, the idea of\n"
"an accomplice isn't really worth considering."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Naturally, if only one person can be saved per murder,\n"
"an accomplice has no <CLT 3>risk versus reward<CLT> benefit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Risk versus reward...benefit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"The payoff for working together—the reward that\n"
"balances out the risk of taking part in the scheme."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"There's no point in being someone's accomplice if\n"
"there's no benefit to you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"However, if there *were* some potential mutual reward\n"
"for the risk, then cooperation becomes possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"You're saying that two people could act as each\n"
"other's accomplices to commit two separate murders."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"I think that's what the true killer told Hifumi; they\n"
"would each have an accomplice for their crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"And based on the case's events, Hifumi would have been\n"
"the first one to act, murdering Taka."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"They made him carry out the first murder so he\n"
"couldn't back out of helping them later on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"So in this case, there wasn't one single person\n"
"committing multiple murders..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Instead, each person killed someone, creating two\n"
"separate incidents."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"And it only looked like one person because that's how\n"
"the true killer designed it to look."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"A single suspicious individual, a similar weapon used\n"
"in each crime, disappearing bodies..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"By creating one seamless set of circumstances, they\n"
"made it look like one person was behind it all!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"The mastermind picked their target and managed to\n"
"convince him to go along with their plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"And then, to avoid the \"no accomplices\" rule, they\n"
"simply...killed their accomplice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Which, if true, means that betraying Hifumi was part\n"
"of the plan from the very beginning."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Th-That's just...awful! How could anyone be so cruel!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"You think so? I can't help but admire its cunning.\n"
"Still, their choice of accomplice seems...odd."

"<CLT 4>The effort made to convince us the two murders were\n"

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"After taking Hifumi to the nurse's office, we all\n"

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"And not too long after that, do you remember what\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"I saw a shadow! Something moving around at the top of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"We headed to the 2nd floor specifically because of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"Next, to draw us all to the physics lab, up on the 3rd\n"
"floor..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "...She let out a bloodcurdling scream."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"And when we'd all come to see what was wrong, what was\n"
"it she said?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "Celeste! What's wrong!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"That was a rather...intense scream for someone like\n"
"you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "I saw him! The strange costumed man...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "He ran off as soon as I screamed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"I was blocking the stairs, so he headed further down\n"
"into the hallway and disappeared...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Once she'd done her job of getting us all up to the\n"
"physics lab..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "...it was time for her partner to get to work."

msgctxt "0101"
msgid "Ungyaaaaaahhh!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "Huh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid "Wh-What was that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "That came from downstairs! It must have been..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "Hifumi! He's in the nurse's office!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "This is bad! Come on, we have to go back!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"It was to get us to divide into two groups...so that\n"
"we would discover both bodies at the same time!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"In fact, Celeste was precisely the one who proposed\n"
"that we split up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "Then why don't we split into two groups?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"I'll lead the hunting party. That seems much more\n"
"interesting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"Very well, then Makoto and Hina, you come with me to\n"
"the nurse's office."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"I will leave the capture of the suspicious individual\n"
"to Toko, Byakuya, and Sakura."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"Well? If Celeste and Hifumi were working together, all\n"
"those chance events suddenly become connected..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"And on top of that...that piercing cry of yours early\n"
"on..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid "Ha-aaaaaahhhh!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid "That was <CLT 3>to signal Hifumi<CLT>, wasn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"It was your way of telling him, \"We're on the 3rd\n"
"floor, everything's going according to plan.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"Why else would you let out a scream that could have\n"
"carried across the sea?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "I just realized another strange thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"When we found Hifumi in the nurse's office, who we now\n"
"know was only pretending to be dead..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid "I certainly was not expecting this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid "I did not imagine that Hifumi..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid "...would be murdered!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid ""
"Celeste...you were the first one to say <CLT 3>he'd been\n"
"murdered<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid ""
"You wanted to make sure we wouldn't have any doubt in\n"
"our minds."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0129"
msgid ""
"I-I don't believe it... Everything...the whole thing\n"
"was one big act!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"Hina. You were with Celeste when Hifumi's body\n"
"disappeared, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""
"Yeah... I was feeling kinda sick, so Celeste took me\n"
"to the bathroom..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid "...Wait! Then that was—!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"She wasn't worried about you. She just saw a chance to\n"
"help Hifumi sneak out of the nurse's office."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid ""
"Each piece isn't much by itself, but start putting\n"
"them together and the picture gets very ugly indeed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid "Wouldn't you agree, Celeste?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid "...I have no idea what you mean."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid "Don't bother trying to deny it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid "You made one fatal <CLT 3>mistake<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid "...Oh did I?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"I didn't even catch it myself when you first said it,\n"
"but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid ""
"...looking back, I can say that that one little\n"
"slip-up was your undoing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid "Wh-What are you talking about...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid ""
"I'm talking about what you said after Hifumi's body\n"
"disappeared and we returned to the nurse's office."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid "They must really be enjoying this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid ""
"Enjoying the sight of us standing around, frightened\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid "We're all going to die here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid "We're going to die, just like those guys died..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid ""
"I remember her saying that too, but...I don't\n"
"understand what's so strange about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"
msgid ""
"Then pay attention. Sakura, Toko, and I were first to\n"
"discover Taka's body in the equipment room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0150"
msgid ""
"Then Makoto showed up and told us Hifumi had been\n"
"killed. So Sakura and I left with Makoto."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0151"
msgid ""
"Once we were in the hall, we ran into Celeste, and the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0152"
msgid ""
"Now, the entire time we were together, none of us said\n"
"anything about Taka being dead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0153"
msgid ""
"Think about it—Celeste's <CLT 3>comment<CLT> doesn't make sense.\n"
"It was completely out of place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0154"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I see what you're talking about. Although I\n"
"don't really get what it means..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0155"
msgid ""
"You hear that, Celeste? Everyone's having some trouble\n"
"understanding. Could you repeat what you said?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0156"

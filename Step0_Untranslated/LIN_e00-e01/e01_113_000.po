"The nameplates on my and Sayaka's rooms <CLT 3>got\n"
"switched<CLT>."

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "They got...switched?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"That's right. The nameplates got switched, just like\n"
"the rooms themselves."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"As a result, the nameplate on Sayaka's room actually\n"
"had Makoto's name."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "And the nameplate on Makoto's room had Sayaka's."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"So what you're saying is, the room <CLT 3>Sayaka<CLT> was\n"
"staying in, was actually marked as her room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Then...if someone *did* do what the note said, they\n"
"would end up at Makoto's room, where Sayaka was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Plus, their rooms are right next to each other. So\n"
"switching the nameplates would be no problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"And the one who switched the names was...\n"
"Well of course it wasn't you, right Makoto?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "R-Right..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Okay...then who did it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "The killer"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "The killer had to be the one to switch the nameplates!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Hey, uh...sorry to burst your bubble, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"

"They had no idea that they were actually in your room,\n"

msgctxt "0021"

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"She wanted someone to come to the room she was in, and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"

"Inviting someone to \"your\" room, but not telling them\n"

msgctxt "0042"

msgctxt "0043"

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "What happened then was...probably..."

msgctxt "0046"

msgctxt "0047"

msgctxt "0048"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"

msgctxt "0050"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "Yes, I think you're right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Then...we just have to figure out what happened during\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"That reminds me... There was a replica sword at the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Oh yeah, what's the deal with that sword?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Sayaka suggested I should hold on to it. I thought it\n"
"might come in handy if I had to defend myself..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"It seems pretty likely that the killer used it to\n"

msgid "And there's some on her wrist because..."

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""

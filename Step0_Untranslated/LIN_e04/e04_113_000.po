"Inside each bottle there was a Monokuma figure holding\n"

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"King, rook, bishop, pawn... I definitely remember\n"
"seeing each of those."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"

"And the piece that was inside the broken bottle we\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "...the knight, if I remember."

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "So? What's that m-matter?"

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"I guess you don't know too much about chess, do you?\n"
"Then let me explain..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"In chess, there are <CLT 3>six different pieces<CLT>—the king,\n"
"the queen, the rook, knight, bishop, and pawn."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"What was left intact at the crime scene were the king,\n"
"rook, bishop, and pawn...just those four."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "And on the ground was the knight."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "...Oh! So the <CLT 3>queen<CLT> is missing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"So we only have evidence for five bottles at the\n"
"scene, while one apparently went missing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Yeah! Shogi is way better!"

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Yeah!\n"
"...Wait, n-no! That's not what I mean!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Th-There's still no evidence that h-has anything to do\n"
"w-with this case!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"That bottle c-could have disappeared anytime b-before\n"
"the murder!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"No, it's clear that the missing bottle *is* connected\n"
"to this case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "H-How is it clear!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Think about what state the missing bottle must have\n"
"been in. Maybe then you'll understand..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "It was broken"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"

"<CLT 4>Wait...then the bottle that was missing...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "What m-makes you so sure!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Because there was <CLT 3>evidence<CLT> at the scene that\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"That's right. We found evidence that shows there was\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "And what is this e-evidence!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "No. That by itself isn't ample evidence."

"What you need to show them is what we used to figure\n"

msgctxt "0053"

"It's not e-evidence at all! Don't do th-things\n"

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"H-Hey, what are we gonna do if we really DO run out of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

"<CLT 4>Kyoko and I figured it out before...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Earlier, Kyoko and I did a little <CLT 3>experiment<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"We compared the weight of the broken bottle pieces at\n"
"the scene to one of the unbroken bottles."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"And what we found was that the <CLT 3>collection of pieces\n"
"was heavier<CLT>. And the reason for that is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"...there was actually more than one bottle's worth of\n"
"shattered glass."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "Wh—!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"So from this, we can surmise that <CLT 3>two bottles<CLT> were\n"
"actually broken at the scene of the crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"But someone did their best to clean up the pieces of\n"
"one of the bottles, along with the figure inside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"But when they did, they must have left behind a few\n"
"too many pieces."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"Which is only natural. They certainly had no way to\n"
"measure the exact right number of pieces to remove."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"But...why would they have to try and get rid of it\n"
"like that, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "Because of what it would reveal about the case..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There can be no doubt that the second missing Monokuma\n"

"Toko and Ogre were having fun bowling, using the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "But Toko threw her ball a little too hard, and—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Well, Makoto. Thank you very much for wasting all our\n"

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "No, you're wrong!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Yeah, the Monokuma Bottle definitely broke when I hit\n"

msgctxt "0086"

msgctxt "0090"

"<CLT 4>The reason the second Monokuma Bottle was broken...\n"

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>It must have been used by...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"The bottle that was removed from the scene was used\n"
"the <CLT 3>second time<CLT> Sakura was attacked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"The second wound on Sakura's head came from that\n"
"second bottle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"Given all the evidence, this is the only possible\n"
"conclusion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"The killer wanted to make it look like there was only\n"
"one attack, so they had to get rid of their evidence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"From there, we can conclude that it wasn't Hiro who\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "Wouldn't you agree, Toko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "Wh—!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"And there's the matter of the magazine. You must have\n"
"been in the rec room when the incident took place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"W-W-W-Wait! I admit, maybe there was a s-second\n"
"attack, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"But there's n-no evidence I had anything t-to do with\n"
"it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "No way! You killed her, I'm sure of it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"Sh-Shut up! Until two seconds ago, y-you were claiming\n"
"*you* k-killed her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong! That's just\n"
"the kinda guy I am!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "Plus, I just remembered something that proves it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "Okay, fine, let's hear it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "It was right after I got Ogre's note..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"I was kinda nervous about it, so I went to the rec\n"
"room early. Y'know, to stake it out or whatever..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "So I was waitin' there, and that's when I saw her..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "I saw Toko go into the rec room!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>You did...?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"Pretty soon, Ogre showed up and *she* went in the rec\n"
"room!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"I assumed Toko was still in there, so I figured\n"
"everything would be okay. That's why I headed in..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"But when I got inside, Ogre was all alone! Toko had\n"
"disappeared!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "And you just now decided to share that with us...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"After the shock of thinking I'd killed someone, I\n"
"forgot all about it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"Could someone tighten the screws on his brain?\n"
"I think they've come loose..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "So, Toko! Where the heck did you disappear to!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"You d-don't know what you're talking about. I never\n"
"went in the r-rec room!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"I'm sure she didn't disappear, but maybe she found\n"
"somewhere to hide..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"Hiding i-in the rec room? \n"

msgid ""
"I'm completely unconvinced that <CLT 3>Sakura wrote that\n"
"dying message<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Because if you look at it, the message was almost\n"
"certainly written using a <CLT 3>finger<CLT>, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "...both of her hands were <CLT 3>completely free of blood<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Say wh—!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Then...who did write it...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Hiro could very well have written it himself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"That would explain how he knew about the message in\n"
"the first place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "N-Ngh...grr!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Yeah... Yeah, that's exactly what happened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Ah! He admits it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "I figured as much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "But...why would you write something like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "B-Because..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Because <CLT 3>I killed her<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>You're...admitting to killing her?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"I got Ogre's note, and so I headed to the rec room\n"
"right before noon, just like it said..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "You just did exactly as the note asked? What a fool..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "And when I got there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Sorry, but do you mind waiting? I asked a couple of\n"
"other people to meet, as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "O-Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Would you like a piece of candy? It might help give\n"
"you some energy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "O-Oh, sure... Thanks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"And that's all she said. After that, we just stood\n"
"around in awkward silence..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Suddenly, I heard her mutter something..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "This is it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "I'm going to end it today..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "I'm going to end...everything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"As soon as I heard that, I just knew...\n"
"I knew she was gonna try and kill me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "She was gonna kill me and make her escape!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "So of course I freaked out, and then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"I saw my only chance. I grabbed a Monokuma Bottle from\n"
"the shelf, and smashed it across her head!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"I...I hit her from behind, <CLT 3>before she had any idea<CLT>\n"
"what was happening!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Then she just...went limp. I didn't see her move again\n"
"after that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Once it was over, I pulled myself together. I realized\n"
"if I didn't do something, I'd be caught and executed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"So I wrote <CLT 3>Toko's name<CLT> in blood across a magazine on\n"
"the table, and...I ran away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"I-I can't believe you! You're the worst! I hope you\n"
"d-die!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Well, that's what happened. Go ahead, roast me, boil\n"
"me, do whatever you want..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "You're not gonna get off that easy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "It's death...death for the one that killed Sakura!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "We're ready to vote now, right!? We know who did it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "No, I think there's more to Hiro's story..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "What are you talking about? What else could there be!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"There's one thing that Hiro's story just now doesn't\n"
"explain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"And until we figure that part out, we can't consider\n"
"the case closed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Why the magazine was hidden"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Why he picked Toko"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"W-Well, it wouldn't be that strange for Toko to kill\n"
"someone at random, right? She's the perfect fall girl!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "Don't think your s-suffering is over when you d-die!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"I w-want you to taste all the flavors of e-eternal\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Why he didn't use Sakura's finger"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Why didn't Hiro put blood on Sakura's finger to make\n"
"it look like she'd written it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "I-I just panicked! I didn't even think about that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"The reason he wrote the message in the first place was\n"

msgid ""
"By the time the body was discovered, the magazine had\n"

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Oh. Well, uh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"I didn't hide it. I'm sure I just left it sitting\n"

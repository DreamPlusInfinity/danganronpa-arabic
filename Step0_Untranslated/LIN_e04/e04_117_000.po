msgctxt "0006"

"No, I'm sure she's telling the truth. Anyone who saw\n"

msgctxt "0007"

"What the hell were you even investigating? Are you\n"
"literally blind?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"If you actually looked at the scene of the crime, it\n"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "The <CLT 3>bloodstain<CLT> by the magazines is proof of that."

"Then she must have moved the body after she killed\n"
"her, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"All to make it look like I did it! Cuz when I hit her,\n"
"she *was* sitting in the chair!"

"Hey, come on now. Look at me. I can't carry anything\n"

msgctxt "0027"

msgctxt "0028"

msgctxt "0030"

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Plus, the biggest mystery of all—the locked room—still\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"Until we take care of that, we can't say this case has\n"

msgid ""
"After she killed Sakura, Toko just hid in the locker\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Huh! So she just hid in there till everyone showed up\n"
"and opened the door?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"And while everything was all confused and hectic, she\n"
"just snuck out of the locker into the group!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "No, I don't think that's possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "I saw it for myself"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "I was in the locker"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "The locker was too small"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Personally, no way would I hide in such a tiny locker\n"
"knowing I might get stuck in there!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"

"After all that investigating...that's the best you\n"

msgctxt "0049"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The reason there's no way Toko was hiding in the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Even before we opened the door to the rec room, Hina\n"
"and I both got a look inside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "And at that point, <CLT 3>the locker was already open<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "So obviously Toko couldn't have been hiding in there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "Hrmm... Okay then, where *was* she hiding?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"I dunno! What's this whole \"locked room\"\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "How do you not know!? You killed her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"I think the fact that I don't know proves I DIDN'T\n"

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Y-You're lying!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"No, she's not. I've been saying all along, there's\n"

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"But if Genocide Jill didn't do it, that means Ogre\n"
"didn't die from the shot to the head..."

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "And?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"W-Well, I can't imagine what else could have killed\n"
"her..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "That's because you're overlooking vital information."

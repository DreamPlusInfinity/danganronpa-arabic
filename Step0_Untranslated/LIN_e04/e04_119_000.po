"According to the Monokuma File, Sakura had <CLT 3>vomited\n"
"blood<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"I think we can assume there's a chance this was\n"
"related to her cause of death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"In fact, there was even a trace of blood left around\n"
"her mouth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Well, I mean...maybe when she got hit with the\n"
"bottles, she cut the inside of her mouth..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"If that's all it was, the file wouldn't have specified\n"
"\"vomited blood.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Not to mention, I didn't find any cuts inside her\n"
"mouth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"You even checked in there!? God, you really ARE into\n"
"dead bodies!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"No, I'm not \"into\" dead bodies. What I'm \"into\" is\n"
"solving mysteries."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"But if there wasn't a cut or anything, then what made\n"
"her vomit blood?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Some sort of reaction within her body. Most likely..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Sakura was <CLT 3>poisoned<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Poisoned...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"That's right! This is the conclusion I've arrived at,\n"
"and so there can be no mistake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Ahh! You're making me go all weak in the knees!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "She was poisoned...? It isn't possible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"Is it really so hard to believe? Then let me explain\n"
"exactly how the culprit was able to poison her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "You can...explain it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Of course. If you don't mind..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Everyone, quiet! Shut up and listen to Master!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"

"The key to unlocking this mystery was hiding in the\n"
"chem lab, up on the 4th floor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Huh? Not in the rec room!? Then I could've found it\n"
"all along!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"You never would have, since you gave up on the search\n"
"the moment you were barred from the crime scene."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "Well...yeah, good point..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"There's a big shelving unit in the chem lab that\n"
"houses a variety of mixtures and chemicals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "And that's where I found...this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "I-Is that...the <CLT 3>poison<CLT>!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"It's not an especially powerful poison, but it'll\n"
"still kill you if you drink an entire bottle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"But the specific properties don't matter. What does\n"
"matter, is <CLT 3>where I found it<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "Where'd you find it...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"The shelf is divided up into three sectionsâ€”\n"

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"In section A, dietary supplements; in B, reagents; and\n"
"in C...a variety of lethal chemicals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "And that's where the poison came from!? Section C!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "Well...that's the question, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Section C"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"Huh? But you just said that section A was for\n"
"supplements or whatever..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Strange, isn't it? Why would there be a bottle of\n"
"poison mixed in with all those nutritional additives?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Yeah, so...why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Because the culprit switched it out, that's why."

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"Correct. That wasn't poison in the bottle, but\n"

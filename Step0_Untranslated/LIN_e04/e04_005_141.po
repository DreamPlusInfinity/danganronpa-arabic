"...none other than the <CLT 3>administrators of Hope's Peak\n"
"themselves<CLT>."

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"What!? Wait, hold on! Then the reason we've been\n"

msgctxt "0092"

"It wasn't the work of some psycho freak or criminal\n"

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "Perhaps we should hear the rest..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It seems that the reason they devised this plan was\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "This is how they described that event..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"

msgid ""
"What this means is, one year ago, this thing—this\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"And whatever it was, it forced Hope's Peak to shut\n"
"down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"From there, they decided to use the school as a kind\n"
"of staging ground..."
msgstr ""

"You said you went to get the poison from section C,\n"
"and that's where you spilled the powder, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Yeah...what about it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"And after that, you said you moved from section C to\n"
"section A to get the protein..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"But the <CLT 3>footprints left at the scene<CLT> were *not*\n"
"moving from section C to section A."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "That contradicts what you just said."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Wh—!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Then...maybe she moved in some weird direction on\n"
"purpose to disguise her movements...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "No, that can't be it. Remember what Hina just said?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"I was just...nervous! So I didn't notice I'd left a\n"
"footprint!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Ah—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "What the—? Hina, what's the meaning of this!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "U-Um, well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "You lied to us, plain and simple."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"If you look at the footprints, your movements in the\n"
"chem lab are obvious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"The powder had already been spilled when you came in,\n"
"and you went straight to section A."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"So you never went to section C. Whatever you did\n"
"there, it only involved section A."

msgctxt "0020"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"And the footprints aren't the only problem with her\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Before I explain that part, I'd like to submit some\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "New evidence!? Impossible! There can't be!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"...Are you sure? After all, you're the one that gave\n"
"it to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "I...did?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "It was hidden inside the bottle of poison you gave me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"I'm amazed you of all people would miss such a vital\n"

msgctxt "0030"

"<CLT 4>Huh? A piece of glass...?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "It had sunk to the bottom of the bottle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"And the hidden clue was exposed thanks to you\n"
"ingesting the powder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"I couldn't have solved the mystery without you. So,\n"
"thank you for that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "B-But...what is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Oh, you still don't realize? Well then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "Makoto, why don't you explain it?"

msgctxt "0041"

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"No...that bottle isn't broken. And the color and\n"

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "The window...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"The window we broke to get in was light blue, just\n"
"like that. So I think that must be it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"You're right, it must be. Of course, that leads to\n"
"another question..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"How did a shard of glass from the window get inside\n"
"this bottle of poison?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "What's so strange about that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "Section A of the shelf"

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "The rec room locker"

msgctxt "0068"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0073"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0075"

"What's wrong? Go ahead, tell us what's so odd about\n"
"it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"
"in front of everyone...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"If what Hina told us is true, the bottle shouldn't\n"
"have moved from where she said she put it last..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"What's strange is that...according to <CLT 3>what Hina told\n"
"us<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Where was it the bottle of poison should have been\n"
"when I broke the rec room window?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>According to what Hina told us...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"The bottle of poison was left <CLT 3>on the shelf in the\n"
"chem lab<CLT>. That is what you said, right Hina?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "Uh...umm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"And yet, somehow a piece of glass from the rec room\n"
"window made its way into the bottle..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Then everything Hina told us was <CLT 3>a lie<CLT>!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"In reality, that bottle of poison most definitely\n"
"found its way to the <CLT 3>rec room<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"It was there at least until the window got broken. In\n"
"other words, when the locked room was unlocked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"There's no other way to explain the presence of that\n"
"glass in that bottle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"And then, once the room was opened, the bottle somehow\n"
"got moved back to the shelf in the chem lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"Meanwhile, the protein can we found at the crime scene\n"
"was planted there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"That had to be after the locked room was opened. In\n"
"other words, after Sakura died."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "Wait, hold on... You're moving too fast!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"I'll grant you, the bottle of poison may well have\n"
"been in the rec room when it was locked..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"But how can you say the protein can was put there\n"
"after the room was unlocked!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"We already know she was given the protein can with the\n"
"poison inside, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"If that can wasn't there when she died, how did she\n"
"get poisoned!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "You're right. We do need to explain that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"But before we do, there's something I'd like to\n"
"confirm with everyone here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "It has to do with the protein can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"After Sakura's body was discovered, did anyone move it\n"
"or trip over it or anything like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"What are you talking about? Is this some kind of\n"
"loaded question?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "Not at all. Just answer to the best of your ability."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid "...Well, no. Not that I remember."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "Yeah, me either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "Not me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "Same here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "Y-Yeah, me either..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "Okay then, that settles it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"That proves that the protein can found its way to the\n"
"murder scene *after* the room was opened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "Oh, come on! How can you say that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "How can you know what I don't know!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The reason she can say that is because there's\n"
"evidence...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>There's proof that someone brought the protein can to\n"
"the rec room *after* it was opened!\n"
"<CLT>"

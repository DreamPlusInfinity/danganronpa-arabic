"There's no question that the mastermind is <CLT 3>somewhere\n"
"within the school<CLT>."

"How do you kn-know? Did you find s-some evidence or\n"

"In the back of the data center, I found a <CLT 3>panel\n"
"that controls Monokuma<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"The mastermind must have been using that to control\n"
"him all this time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"So there can't be any doubt, the mastermind has <CLT 3>been\n"
"inside the school<CLT> all along!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "There can't be any doubt..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"In which case, there also can be no doubt that the\n"
"mastermind is one of us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "What? Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Recall what Makoto told us <CLT 3>Monokuma said to him<CLT>\n"
"earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "I'm sure I told you this already, but..."

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"...this <CLT 3>killing game<CLT> began with sixteen\n"
"participants, all of them high school students."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"And the only people to take a single step in Hope's\n"
"Peak since the killing game began..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "...are those sixteen students."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"So if the mastermind *is* in the school, we have to\n"
"assume it can only be that <CLT 3>16th student<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "But...how'd they m-manage to survive all of this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "So we're the only ones here...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "I-It's not me! I'm not the mastermind!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Well it's not me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "I blame M-Makoto!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "What!? Why me!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"C-Cuz! It's super weird how you're the o-only one who\n"
"survived being executed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Oh, I get it! The only way he coulda survived is if he\n"
"was actually the mastermind himself, right!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Aww nuts! Ya got me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "W-Wait, what are you trying to say!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Everyone, calm down. There's no reason to panic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"The mastermind's true identity will become clear soon\n"
"enough. Just as soon as we find out who killed Mukuro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "That's a good point."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Rather than wasting time bickering, we should put our\n"
"minds to work solving this mystery."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"Yeah, well, how much time have we already spent\n"
"talking about the murder?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "He's r-right. What more is there to t-talk about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"If you want something to talk about, I think there\n"
"might be one thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"We haven't fully established what Mukuro's <CLT 3>fatal\n"
"injury<CLT> was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Huh? But...I thought we figured that out. She died\n"
"when she <CLT 3>got hit in the back of the head<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"No, that isn't actually what killed her. It was\n"
"something entirely different."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Wouldn't you agree, Makoto?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "The other wounds"

msgctxt "0038"

"We said the same thing during the last trial, but are\n"
"you sure it's true?"

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Oh, now I remember... You said there was a chance the\n"
"blow to her head came *after* she was killed...\n"

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "The stab wound"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "No, the stab wound was more camouflage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "You proved that yourself in the last class trial."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Oh yeah, now that you mention it...\n"

msgctxt "0047"

"All of the <CLT 3>wounds<CLT> covering her body... That's what\n"

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Hey, now hold on a second! You did read the Monokuma\n"
"File, right?"

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>\"The body was covered with other wounds, but these\n"
"were at least several days old.\"\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"It made it pretty clear. Those wounds were made *at\n"
"least* a few days ago."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "So they can't possibly be what killed her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Consider this—what if the murder itself took place at\n"
"least a few days ago?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Wh-What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"What if, when we discovered her body, she'd already\n"
"been dead for several days?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"If that's true, then naturally the wounds that killed\n"
"her would appear to be however many days old."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "Th-That doesn't make any sense!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"Because...because she had all th-those wounds before\n"
"she ever c-came here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Huh? How do you know that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Isn't it o-obvious? She was the <CLT 3>Ultimate Soldier<CLT>,\n"

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "You're wrong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Ahaha... She d-denied me... Hahahaha... Before I could\n"

"Hahah...ha...ahe...hehehe...! Come on—I mean—you think\n"
"I'm—?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"I'm not weird, okay!? At least l-listen to what I have\n"

msgid ""
"If the guilty party is exposed during the class trial,\n"

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "It's unfortunate, but that *is* the rule..."

msgctxt "0010"

"So now I gotta punish you again! And this time I won't\n"

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Do whatever you feel you have to."

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "But before you do, let me just say one thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"If you execute Makoto, that means you lose. Not that\n"
"that matters to you, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "I...lose?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "You! Explain yourself! What do you mean by that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Well you set up this latest class trial yourself,\n"
"right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"I was getting in your way, so you wanted an excuse to\n"
"kill me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"I was supposed to be chosen as the blackened and then\n"
"executed, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "H-Hey, what are you talking about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"But when Makoto chose to overlook my lie, your plan\n"
"came crashing down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"The results of the trial weren't at all what you were\n"
"expecting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"Because you never imagined that in that position, one\n"
"person would protect another like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "And in response to that unexpected development..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"...you reacted by proclaiming *Makoto* the blackened\n"
"and trying to execute *him*."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"You made the choice out of desperation. No, more than\n"
"that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"You must have realized that Makoto, who refused to be\n"
"manipulated, was a threat to you, as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"But then there was *another* unexpected development\n"
"waiting for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"An entity that would throw a wrench, so to speak, in\n"
"your precious execution machinery."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Alter Ego..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"You never imagined the possibility of a being that\n"
"could come to our aid even after you'd \"killed\" it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Now, here's the absolute truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Makoto didn't kill Mukuro. You did."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"So executing Makoto for it would surely be a violation\n"
"of your rules, which I know you love so much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"If the blackened is exposed, they alone will be\n"
"executed. That's what you told us, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "Hmph. And that means I lose?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"You talk a big game. You're saying the blackened is me\n"
"and not Makoto?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "And you can prove this, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "No, I can't."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Don't just say it like that!\n"

"What is this, a comedy routine? To make such bold\n"
"claims without a shred of evidence..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"I don't have any right now, but with a little more\n"
"time I guarantee I'll find some."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Because no matter how deeply you try to bury it, there\n"
"is only ever one absolute truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"And now you're trying to talk like some kind of famous\n"
"detective type?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"If Makoto really was the killer, he never would have\n"
"come to you willingly like this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"He would have feared for his life, feared another\n"
"execution. He would have tried to run and hide."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"He would have been gripped by the despair you so love\n"
"to inspire."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"But here we are—confronting you with nothing but hope\n"
"in our hearts."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"And that's supposed to be enough to convince me in the\n"
"absence of evidence?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "It's not you I'm trying to convince."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"If you were to execute Makoto now, <CLT 3>everyone out there\n"
"watching this<CLT> would be extremely displeased."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Imagine what everyone out there would think if you\n"
"killed Makoto..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"They would assume that you killed him because what we\n"
"said is exactly right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "<CLT 3>Despair<CLT> can never kill <CLT 3>hope<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Grh—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"Of course, you can say we're just making this all up.\n"
"You're welcome to prove us wrong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "No, you have no choice *but* to prove it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Because if you kill Makoto without proving your own\n"
"innocence, you'll be accepting your own defeat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "Gh-grg-grah!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "If you want to earn our despair \"fair and square\"..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "...then I suggest you take my advice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "So? What is this \"advice\" of yours?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "To do Mukuro's trial over again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Only this time, you follow the school regulations to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"It's time for one last showdown—one final battle\n"
"between <CLT 3>hope<CLT>...and <CLT 3>despair<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"Well? That would make for a proper climax, wouldn't\n"
"you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>A fair trial...one last showdown... In other words...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>This would be our chance to expose the true identity\n"
"of Mukuro's killer—of the mastermind themselves!\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But...what reason would the mastermind have to accept\n"

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Oh, I was getting bored, so I decided to change things\n"
"up a little. So, time for bear jokes!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"Now, what you've suggested might be pawsible. It would\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Does that mean you accept?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"If we do things your way, that'll be enough to\n"
"convince you *and* the viewers, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "And it would cause you unbearable despair, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "Then I'm prebeared to agree to your terms!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Will your hope win out? Or will my desbear claim\n"
"victory...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "Let's have one final grizzly showdown!"

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>He agreed...!\n"

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Then we still have a shot at this...!\n"

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"But this is the long-awaited climax, right? Just\n"
"guessing the killer is bearly a fitting end."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"So for this final face-off, you'll have to unearth all\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "All the mysteries...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"That's right. Every last mystery that's pawing around\n"
"the school. If you can do that..."

msgctxt "0096"

"...then that'll be enough to koalafy as a victory for\n"
"you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "That's what we've been trying to do all along..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "Okay, well, good! Then let's bear it all!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"If you can claw your way to the truth of Mukuro's\n"
"death, AND solve the mysteries of this school..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "...then you win!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid "But if you *can't* do all of that..."

msgctxt "0102"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "Do you remember the rule?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"When one student kills another, that's when a class\n"

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "I remember that, fur sure. So what?"

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"I just want to confirm, that *is* what you said,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"Kehehe. You don't have to be so suspicious. I've said\n"
"it before, but it bears repeating..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "Everything is based on the school regulations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "And having a trial for Mukuro is no exception to that."

msgctxt "0116"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Mukuro's trial is no exception? Then...it's part of\n"

"<CLT>"

"<CLT 4>Which would have to mean that whoever killed Mukuro...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... It's a very polarizing approach, I know,\n"
"but—okay, enough puns. Anyway, here's a hint..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "I'm sure I told you this already, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"...this <CLT 3>killing game<CLT> began with sixteen\n"

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"And the only people to take a single step in Hope's\n"
"Peak since the killing game began..."

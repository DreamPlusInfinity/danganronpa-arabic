"The two of them...may have switched places <CLT 3>from the\n"
"very beginning<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "What...? From the beginning?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Yes, from the moment we first met."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "If that's when they switched..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"...then they wouldn't have had to switch at the moment\n"
"of death, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"After all, the one we saw at that point would have\n"
"already been Mukuro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"H-Hold on...! So you're saying the \"Junko\" we first\n"
"met..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "...was actually Mukuro all along!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Th-Then...we'd already met her!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "I had, like, a normal conversation with her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"When we first met, none of us knew who anyone else\n"
"was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"So Mukuro could have simply told us her name was\n"
"Junko..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "...and we never would have known the difference."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"That would easily allow the two of them to switch\n"
"places from the very beginning."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Wait, but Mukuro had a <CLT 3>tattoo<CLT> on the back of her\n"
"hand, right!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "Junko never had any tattoo like that, did she?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"She could have hidden it with <CLT 3>foundation<CLT> or\n"
"something like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"If she did, it likely melted away in the explosion,\n"
"exposing the tattoo after the body was extinguished."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Plus, there were the <CLT 3>fake nails<CLT> found on the hands\n"
"of Mukuro's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"They were the same <CLT 3>fake red nails<CLT> she was wearing\n"
"when we all met for the first time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "B-But...if she really did use foundation..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Correct. Even if there was no tattoo on her hand, I\n"
"couldn't say for certain it wasn't Mukuro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"So I'm glad nobody noticed that glaring hole when we\n"
"were trying to figure out who attacked Makoto..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"But too bad for you, Monokuma. You can't deny it\n"
"anymore."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"Wait, so...! This whole thing was a set-up from\n"
"the very beginning!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"If that's true, it was quite an elaborate plan, to be\n"
"sure. Making it look like Mukuro was Junko..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"The reason such an elaborate plan was possible is\n"
"because the two of them were working together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"So Mukuro, the <CLT 3>Ultimate Despair<CLT>, teamed up with\n"
"someone like her..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"In other words, it would be fair to say that Junko\n"
"herself was also the <CLT 3>Ultimate Despair<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "What's wrong? Lost the will to fight back?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "I think he's just afraid..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Afraid? What's that mean, afraid?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Fear is only possible where hope is possible. I only\n"
"have despair, so fear is an alien concept to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Then why haven't you been saying anything?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Because it's a bunch of nonsense. Junko's my secret\n"
"identity?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Puhuhu! As if!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Then why did you try and protect Junko's real\n"
"identity?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "I tried to protect her identity?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "When did I do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So he still refuses to admit it. But...\n"

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Because I've already figured it out...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Hold on. What matters now is presenting the right\n"
"evidence...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>It has to do with what Monokuma tried to keep me from\n"

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>I...don't think this is what I need to corner\n"

"Wait, what? Were you just going with the flow or\n"
"something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"No, we definitely have the proof we need. Right,\n"
"Makoto?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Y-yeah, I'm sure of it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Hmm. Okay then, let's see it!"

"interviews<CLT> with the headmaster..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>It wasn't just the monitor. The DVD player itself had\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"

msgctxt "0064"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "That's what failure IS, right!?"

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"You made sure I couldn't finish watching the video.\n"
"And the reason you did that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"...is because you didn't want me to see the <CLT 3>real\n"
"Junko<CLT>, did you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Oh, yeah! If everyone was in that video, of course\n"
"Junko would've had to show up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "And if Makoto saw the real Junko..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"...it would've been totally obvious that the Junko we\n"
"met was an imposter!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "Th-That whole power outage thing was just a fluke!"

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>No, it wasn't a fluke. The mastermind definitely\n"

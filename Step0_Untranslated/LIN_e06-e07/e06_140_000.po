"It could only have been...the <CLT 3>headmaster<CLT> of Hope's\n"
"Peak Academy."

msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"He wanted to turn the school into a shelter to try and\n"
"protect us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"To protect us...from the despair and tragedy taking\n"
"place outside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "That's why he asked us to make that promise..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"To say that we were willing to live in this school\n"
"forever."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "We believe he had something like that in mind, yes."

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"If you, the collective hope of a new generation, could\n"
"survive, maybe the world could have a fresh start."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Yeah...the headmaster put that much faith in you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "And because we had that same hope..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "That's why we all agreed...to <CLT 3>live here forever<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"But creating the shelter was also his single biggest\n"
"mistake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Puhuhu... It's laughable, really. He was the\n"
"headmaster, but he had nooo idea."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"He had no idea that we, the <CLT 3>Ultimate Despair<CLT>, had\n"
"already made our way into the school."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"So what was supposed to be a shelter to keep you\n"
"safe..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"...became a <CLT 3>cage<CLT> that made it impossible for you to\n"
"escape despair."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Puhuhu. I have to say, it really helped me out a lot!\n"
"It saved me a ton of time."

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"By the way, it was you yourselves who blocked off the\n"
"windows, the doors, all the exits."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Under the headmaster's direction, you all went about\n"
"your work like obedient little sheep."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "You mean...we trapped ourselves in here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"And then you forgot all about it, and started bitching\n"
"about how you were trapped in here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Once you'd finished building your little shelter, it\n"
"was time for me and Mukuro to get to work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "And thus began the killing game!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Me and Mukuro had come here, spending the last two\n"
"years waiting for that moment..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"That moment where <CLT 3>you all began killing each other<CLT>\n"
"served as the climax of our global despair plan!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"And the only reason you survived The Tragedy was so\n"
"that you could be part of it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"You only let us live...so we could go around killing\n"
"each other. Is that what you're saying?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Why...? Why would you do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"Because this was so much more than a simple high\n"
"school death match..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Rather, it was a method to hunt down and destroy every\n"
"last remaining speck of hope in the world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "What are you saying?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"Well, it would seem that there's a little bit left out\n"
"there, a few souls unwilling to give up hope..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "So I thought I should show them. Which is why I..."

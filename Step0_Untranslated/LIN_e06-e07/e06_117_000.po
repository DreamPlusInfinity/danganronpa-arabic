msgctxt "0003"

"That's simple. Just recall who's died here so far, and\n"

msgctxt "0014"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"That's right. Any other number should make you\n"

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"I got it! The mastermind destroyed one of the bodies\n"
"to get rid of evidence!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"But if they wanted to do that, they would've destroyed\n"
"Mukuro's body, since they actually killed her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "And yet...her body was left alone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Including Monokuma's executions, there have apparently\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "That's the point I'm trying to make."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"I'm completely lost! How can the number of victims be\n"

msgctxt "0028"

msgctxt "0030"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"

msgctxt "0049"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "Huh? Killed twice...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "Officially, ten murders have been committed so far."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"But one of the victims may have been murdered...and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "Murdered and...m-murdered again...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"If that's the case, there could have been ten killings\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"T-Technically you're right I guess, but\n"
"still...something like that—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Could easily have happened. No, it *is* what happened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Sounds like you're already convinced. Then can you\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "It was <CLT 3>Mukuro<CLT>, of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Before she was killed as Mukuro Ikusaba, she was\n"
"killed as someone else."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"And that's why the body had to be stored in the bio\n"
"lab until the moment we found it in the garden..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"No no no, that's crazy talk! She was killed as someone\n"
"else? Come on!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Besides, who could that \"someone else\" even have\n"
"been!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"All you have to do is look at those bodily injuries of\n"
"hers and that will become obvious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "Nothing's gonna become obvious...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "Because Kyoko's totally delusional!"

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "...Indeed."

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Well then, let me get straight to the point."

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"It's something you can't talk about in front\n"
"of the surveillance cameras, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "So does that mean...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Does this have something to do with whatever it is\n"
"you stole from Monokuma?"

msgctxt "0008"

msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0009"

"Monokuma told us earlier that someone had stolen\n"

msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "That's right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "So I was right..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "But what did you steal?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "I stole this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "A...<CLT 3>key<CLT>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But looking at it, I could tell it wasn't just any\n"
"key.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>It was shaped like <CLT><CLT 3>Monokuma<CLT><CLT 4>. It was probably the\n"

"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Where did you get this...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "From <CLT 3>the headmaster's room<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "What!? You snuck into the headmaster's room!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "But...wasn't it locked?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "The lock was broken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "It was Sakura. She did it for us..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "She did...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"Remember what she said in her note? \"<CLT 3>I'm not going to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "So...Sakura broke into the headmaster's room for us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"That's right. So that we could uncover whatever\n"
"secrets might lay hidden within..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "She did that...for us..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>She violated the school regulations to help us.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>She'd already decided to die, so her last act was to\n"

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"I noticed the room was open after the class trial was\n"
"over yesterday."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"But if I'd just strolled into the room, Monokuma would\n"
"have noticed right away. Which is why..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "...I used you as a decoy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"So you asked me to meet you at the data center in\n"
"order to..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Correct. I wanted you to draw Monokuma's attention."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"I took that opportunity to sneak into the headmaster's\n"
"room. And as a result..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "...I found this key."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "Wow..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Then...what you told me about yesterday—did that come\n"
"from the headmaster's room, too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Mukuro Ikusaba..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"The sixteenth student, lying hidden somewhere in this\n"
"school..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "The one they call the Ultimate Despair..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Watch out for her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Did you find out about this <CLT 3>Mukuro Ikusaba<CLT> while you\n"
"were in there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"I did find a file in the headmaster's room that talked\n"
"about her, yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "I don't know all the details yet, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"...one thing I do know, is that Mukuro Ikusaba is\n"
"<CLT 3>dangerous<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "D-Dangerous...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "She may very well be the mastermind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "M-Mastermind!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"But didn't Alter Ego say that the headmaster was\n"
"probably the mastermind?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"No...the headmaster isn't the mastermind, I'm sure of\n"
"that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "I don't have proof yet, but I have no doubt I'm right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>To make such a strong statement without proof...\n"
"That's not like Kyoko at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>But...if it isn't the headmaster...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...does that mean Mukuro Ikusaba really could be the\n"
"mastermind?\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"Anyway, this key is the one big opportunity we've been\n"
"waiting to get our hands on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Now that we've grasped it, we can't let it go, can we?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "Sure, but I mean...what's this key even unlock?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "I don't know yet. Which is why..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"...I need you to draw Monokuma's attention again,\n"
"while I go and find out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "Wait, so you're planning on sneaking back in again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "You can't! That's way too dangerous!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"And you want me to draw his attention, but we don't\n"
"actually know there's just one mastermind, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "If there's more than one person watching us..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "But they didn't catch on last night, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "Maybe we just got lucky..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"Or maybe the mastermind can't monitor us and control\n"
"Monokuma <CLT 3>at the same time<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "...Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "Like I said, we didn't get caught last night."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "But as you said, maybe it was pure luck."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Which is why we're going to run the experiment one\n"
"more time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "And if we're successful again..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"...then what may have just been a lucky guess will be\n"
"proven true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>As Kyoko talked, she was calm and collected as ever. I\n"
"couldn't help but just stand there and listen.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"If it's true that the mastermind can't watch us and\n"
"control Monokuma at the same time..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"...then there would have to be a period of time where\n"
"the mastermind is vulnerable."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"What we need to do is find out for sure if that's\n"
"actually true, and if we can exploit it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "Maybe, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"No matter what the reward, the risk is just too high.\n"
"When I think what might happen if we fail..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"I don't think you need to worry all that much. After\n"
"all..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"<CLT 23>With minimal restrictions, you are free to explore\n"
"Hope's Peak Academy at your discretion.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"No restrictions have been placed on our efforts to\n"
"solve the mystery, am I wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"Even when I took the key, I didn't break any rules as\n"
"far as I can tell."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"But if the mastermind decides to do something, all the\n"
"rules in the world won't matter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "He could just kill us all without a second thought!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"I see... In that case, even if the plan fails, we'll\n"
"still be able to prove or disprove that hypothesis."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"In a moment of crisis, will the mastermind break their\n"
"own rules, or adhere to them no matter what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"In other words, we gain something whether we succeed\n"
"or not. Now there's no reason not to do it, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "B-But—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"If you spend all your time trying to avoid danger,\n"
"you'll never move forward."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"We know the danger. But if that risk means solving the\n"
"mystery, we have no choice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "Am I wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>At that moment, I finally realized...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...I had never seen the slightest hint of fear or\n"
"despair in Kyoko's eyes.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Her gaze was firmly fixed on the mystery ahead, the\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>...she just smiled.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "I can't change how I feel, and wouldn't if I could."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Then Kyoko took something from her coat pocket and\n"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid "Huh? What's this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"Consider it a symbol of my determination. Don't open\n"

msgctxt "0106"

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "I-If something happens!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"I'm not planning on dying. But there's always a chance\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "Please, I want you to hold on to it for me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"Fine. I'll hold on to it, just because you asked me\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid "Yes...of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "Oh, and one more thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "You can't tell anyone else about what I've discovered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"Sure, because then there's a chance the mastermind\n"
"might find out, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid "Well...there's that, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid "Huh...? You mean...there's something else?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "It's nothing. Forget I said anything."

msgctxt "0119"

"<CLT 4>I-I can't just forget that easily...\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "Okay then, shall we begin?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "I'm counting on you, Makoto."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"I just have to get Monokuma's attention, right? Well,\n"

msgid ""
"<CLT 4>What *wasn't* like every other time...\n"
"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0127"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid "No...everything's gonna be fine, I know it...!"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "But we didn't have access to the garden until today."

msgctxt "0040"

msgctxt "0044"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "How are you gonna call for help with a lawnmower!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"

"<CLT 4>The awful scene in that room...\n"
"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0185"

"<CLT 4>That was \"The Tragedy\" that happened a year ago?\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0187"
msgid "If that's true..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0188"

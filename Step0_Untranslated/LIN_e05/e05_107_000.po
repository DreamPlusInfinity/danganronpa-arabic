msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Fenrir, the Wolf of Ragnarok. It's from Norse\n"
"mythology. A huge, world-ending wolf beast..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"He's the ch-child of the trickster god, Loki, and a\n"

"Man! After all this time, we finally got a glimpse of\n"
"the literary all-star!"

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "A wolf tattoo... Then that means—!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Exactly. The body we found had a tattoo of a wolf."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Which means that person must have once belonged to\n"
"Fenrir."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "So it must have been <CLT 3>Mukuro<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"H-Hold on... Isn't she the one that was behind this\n"
"whole thing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Ah-ha-ha-ha! You sound surprised! But you're\n"
"absolutely right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Yes, indeed! The trial this time is to solve <CLT 3>the\n"
"murder of Mukuro Ikusaba<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Wh-What? Are you saying the m-mastermind is dead...and\n"
"now we have to have a c-class trial?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"No. It means we were wrong in thinking that Mukuro was\n"
"the mastermind at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"But, I mean...being the <CLT 3>Ultimate Despair<CLT> seems like\n"
"a pretty mastermind-y title to me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"Maybe we shouldn't have been thinking of her as the\n"
"<CLT 3>Ultimate Despair<CLT> in the first place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"After all, looking at her profile, I didn't see\n"
"anything that would fit such a description..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "All it said was that she was the <CLT 3>Ultimate Soldier<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"If I remember correctly, that other information came\n"
"from..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Kyoko, that's what you told Makoto, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "So that means...Kyoko got it wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Then...who was she? Who was Mukuro Ikusaba?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"She's been gone this whole time, and when she finally\n"
"turns up, she gets killed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"Usually, when there's a s-scene where an important\n"
"character dies, it has a lot m-more detail..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "So you're saying she wasn't an important character?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"Which would mean she was the same as us—just another\n"
"<CLT 3>participant<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Then who's the real mastermind?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"It must have been th-the Hope's Peak Academy\n"
"<CLT 3>headmaster<CLT>, a-after all...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "No, the headmaster has nothing to do with it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"But how can we trust that? We already know your\n"
"information about Mukuro was wrong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "My information was not wrong..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Okay, okay! We're in the middle of a trial right now!\n"

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Please limit all future prattle, chatter, and\n"
"chit-chat as much as possible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"...Fine. Uncovering the identity of the mastermind\n"
"will have to wait. But remember this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"No matter what happens, we *will* find out who you\n"
"really are. I stake my <CLT 3>family name<CLT> on it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"I have officially decided to completely ignore all\n"
"such attempts at provocation!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Now then, just so nobody's confused, let me state this\n"
"one more time for the record..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"The reason we're having a class trial is because a\n"
"murder among the students has taken place!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "Hammer that point straight into your big ol' brains!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"What you're saying is that both the victim and the\n"
"culprit are part of the student body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Then...one of us killed Mukuro?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Wait, no! There's a chance that there's some mystery\n"
"17th person who's been hiding all along!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Nope! There are only 16 students in total that have\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Seriously!? Then...one of us killed Mukuro!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Who d-did it!? Who's the killer th-this time!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Get a hold of yourself. We've already narrowed down\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Huh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "Makoto and Kyoko"
msgstr ""

"<CLT 4>Based on what we know, there can only be two\n"

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "You've narrowed it down to...<CLT 3>Kyoko, and me<CLT>. Right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "...Why do you say that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "Allow me to explain..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Just after nighttime last night, I went to the garden.\n"
"So I can confirm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "...that at that point, there was no dead body there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"So, the murder must have taken place after I left the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"However...Hiro, Toko, Hina and I were in the gym the\n"
"entire time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "The gym...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"That's right. The four of us were there trying to\n"
"<CLT 3>dismantle Monokuma<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"The whole time we were very careful not to go anywhere\n"
"alone. We even went to the bathroom in pairs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"All of which is to say...the four of us all have\n"
"alibis. The only ones without alibis..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"...are me and Makoto. That's why you're able to narrow\n"
"down the list of suspects."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "Exactly so."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>So the only suspects now are me and Kyoko.\n"
"<CLT>"

msgctxt "0077"

"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"Um, I have something I'd like to say regarding the\n"
"whole alibi thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "...Are you thinking of raising an objection?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"Well, before that, I just want to try and get a better\n"
"idea of <CLT 3>what time<CLT> the murder took place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "Doing that might reveal some kind of clue..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "Whatever you want. Somebody go ahead and help him out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"Me and Byakuya can both confirm that the body wasn't\n"
"in the garden at..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Well, it was after nighttime for sure. I'd say it must\n"
"have been around <CLT 3>10 o'clock<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "So the murder musta happened after 10 p.m."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"Then I guess we can say the timeframe for the murder\n"
"was between then and when we found the body...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "Oh, but...what time did we find the body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "At 10 o'clock"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "Huh? Are you sure about that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"I've sorta lost all sense of time since we got trapped\n"
"here..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"Oh! But didn't Toko say something about the time right\n"
"before she went to get the pickaxe?"

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"Huh? Had that much time really gone by? I feel like it\n"

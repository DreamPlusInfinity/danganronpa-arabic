"Wait, hold on. <CLT 3>The stab wound<CLT> isn't what killed\n"
"Mukuro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"That should be clear from the description of the\n"
"cover-up we just heard!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Lies! We never talked about what killed her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "No, don't you remember?"

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"The killer covered the dead body with the tarp, and\n"
"then put the bloody coat on it, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"In other words, the victim never wore that\n"
"bloodstained coat until <CLT 3>after they were dead<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "Okay, fine! So what!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "So, when we discovered the body..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"...the knife had been thrust through the coat along\n"
"with the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Meaning, if she wasn't stabbed until the coat was put\n"
"on, and she was already dead at that point..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "...obviously the stab wound isn't what killed her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"M-Maybe you stabbed her twice! Once to kill her,\n"
"and once to cover it up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "We already know about the b-body...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"The important thing n-now is whether she was stabbed\n"
"in the s-same spot twice, right!?"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"How does that have anything to do with what actually\n"
"killed her?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"That's your plan, isn't it!? To push the story in that\n"
"direction and away from your dirty deeds!"

"himself! That proves it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"He stabbed her twice! The first time to kill her, and\n"
"the second time to cover it up!"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "Oh yeah, it sure did! I totally forgot about that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Then the knife..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"...was just another piece of <CLT 3>camouflage<CLT> set up by\n"
"the true killer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"They probably stabbed her to draw attention away from\n"
"<CLT 3>what actually killed her<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Exploding the body afterward was probably meant to do\n"
"the same thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"The explosion severely damaged the body, making it\n"
"impossible to know what really killed her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"It was all the killer's attempt to <CLT 3>destroy all\n"
"evidence<CLT> of their crime!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"So they wanted us to notice the stab wound, and then\n"
"detonated the body afterward..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"They meant for us to latch onto the knife as the cause\n"
"of death, then destroy any evidence proving otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Oh, hey, I have a question! It kinda goes back to the\n"
"beginning, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"What's the deal with that explosion, anyway? Why'd the\n"
"body just blow up all of a sudden like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"If you bothered to put that lump of grey matter\n"
"between your ears to use, you'd know the answer..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Well if you're so smart, just tell me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"I'll tell ya! I bet some unknown quantum particle\n"
"caused an atomic-level spontaneous combustion!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"I might be dumb, but even I'm not dumb enough to\n"
"believe that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Go ahead, Makoto. Tell her, or we won't make any\n"
"headway on this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You're no\n"
"different from them at this point..."

msgctxt "0051"

"<CLT 4>There's only one explanation I can think of for the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"After the explosion, we found a <CLT 3>tiny fragment<CLT> of\n"
"something on the ground near the body, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "That fragment reveals the <CLT 3>cause<CLT> of the explosion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Huh? You know, I feel like I've seen something like it\n"
"somewhere before..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "That's only natural. Because, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "We saw the same thing when we dismantled Monokuma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "It's <CLT 3>part of a bomb<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Oh! Then the explosion was cuz of the Monokuma bomb!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Anyway, the culprit's motive is becoming more and more\n"
"obvious by the minute."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"They wanted the knife wound to look like the fatal\n"
"injury so that we'd suspect Makoto."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "And the only one who would benefit from that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "...is the only other possible suspect. You, <CLT 3>Kyoko<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Hold on a second, Byakuya..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "...What's the problem?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"Well I just feel like...we need to think this through.\n"
"We still don't know what actually killed the victim."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"That's true! It's definitely bugging me. What really\n"
"killed her...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"...Fine, I have no problem with that. Let us continue\n"
"the debate."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "It won't change the facts of the case, regardless."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0076"

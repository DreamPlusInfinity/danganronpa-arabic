msgctxt "0109"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "But...why there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"

msgctxt "0112"

"It's a layout of <CLT 3>the entirety of Hope's Peak\n"

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"Some of the staff must have had to stay overnight from\n"

msgctxt "0117"

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid "And that's when I finally remembered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"I remembered that my purpose was to find the owner of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"So you went there to see if the headmaster really did\n"
"have a private room there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"But once I got there, I noticed that the \n"
"<CLT 1>[2nd floor of the dorms]<CLT>\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"

msgid "I know you're right. But that just means..."

"Everyone but you and me <CLT 3>had an alibi<CLT>. So then who\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"

msgctxt "0143"

msgctxt "0145"
msgid "It was...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid "The mastermind knew they couldn't interfere directly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"

msgctxt "0108"

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "But...why there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"

msgctxt "0112"
msgid "This is...some kind of map?"

msgid ""
"It's a layout of <CLT 3>the entirety of Hope's Peak\n"

msgctxt "0115"

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"Some of the staff must have had to stay overnight from\n"

msgctxt "0117"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"I assumed that if that were true, that room would\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid "And that's when I finally remembered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"I remembered that my purpose was to find the owner of\n"
"that room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"So you went there to see if the headmaster really did\n"
"have a private room there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"But once I got there, I noticed that the \n"
"<CLT 1>[2nd floor of the dorms]<CLT>\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"

msgctxt "0134"
msgid "[what was going on]"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid "Just to be perfectly clear, I didn't kill her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid "And I know it wasn't you, either."

msgctxt "0138"
msgid "I know you're right. But that just means..."

"Everyone but you and me <CLT 3>had an alibi<CLT>. So then who\n"

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"What I can say for sure is that the mastermind is\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"

msgctxt "0143"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid "It was...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid "The mastermind knew they couldn't interfere directly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"

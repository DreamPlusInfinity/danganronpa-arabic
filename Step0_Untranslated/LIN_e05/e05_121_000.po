msgid ""
"You're right. Just the one arrow would've been too\n"
"weak. That's why the killer used <CLT 3>another weapon<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Another weapon...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Inside the dojo locker, we also found a balled-up wad\n"
"of <CLT 3>duct tape<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"The killer probably used this duct tape to <CLT 3>bind<CLT>\n"
"multiple arrows together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Bundling them together using the duct tape would\n"
"easily create a <CLT 3>single weapon as thick as a pipe<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "And that's exactly what the killer did!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"It's similar to Aesop's fable about the bundle of\n"
"sticks..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"One stick is weak, but put them together, and they\n"
"become strong. It's meant to teach cooperation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "Damn, that's harsh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "How is it harsh? Were you even listening?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Anyway, that explains the murder weapon."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"As for who the culprit is that stashed the weapon in\n"
"the dojo locker..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "It was you, Kyoko!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "...I've never been to the dojo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "Oh no, you absolutely have."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "How can you say that with such confidence?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Because we have proof, of course. Don't we, Makoto?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "O-Oh, um..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Hm? What's the matter?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Surely you don't intend to protect a murderer..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "You know what will happen if you do, don't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"If you cover for the culprit, there's only one thing\n"
"that can lead to..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "The death of us all. Remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "O-Of course I remember...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"Then show us! Show everyone the evidence that proves\n"
"Kyoko went to the dojo!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "So. You *do* intend to protect a murderer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "What's he talking about, Makoto!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "Yeah! Tell us, or we're all dead, remember!?"

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0033"

msgid "The one thing that proves Kyoko was in the dojo is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "...right here. The <CLT 3>key to the dojo locker<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "And how does that prove anything?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Because...I found it in your room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "It was...in my room?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Don't bother trying to play dumb."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"

msgid ""
"Your non-existent alibi, your clear motive, your\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"

"This all proves that you are the true culprit. You\n"

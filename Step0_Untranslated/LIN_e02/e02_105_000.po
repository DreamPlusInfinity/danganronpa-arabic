"I found this file while I was looking around the\n"
"archive in the library..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"I guess it's some kind of confidential file the police\n"
"put together about the Genocide Jack case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"What...? That's kinda weird as shit, isn't it? What\n"
"was something like that doing in the library?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"The why of it is probably more trouble than it's\n"
"worth, so let's forget about that for now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"More importantly, it outlines all the specifics of\n"
"every Genocide Jack case in exceeding detail."

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"According to the file, there appear to be <CLT 3>two\n"
"defining characteristics<CLT> in every Genocide Jack case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"The first is that a <CLT 3>bloody message<CLT> is found written\n"
"at the scene of every murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Oh, that's right! \"<CLT 3>Booblust<CLT>\"!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Uh, no...it's actually \"<CLT 3>bloodlust<CLT>\"..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"But more important is the <CLT 3>other characteristic<CLT>. And\n"
"it's something that has never been made public..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "Never made public...? What the hell is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Why don't you tell them, Makoto?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "How the victim was positioned"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "In every single Genocide Jack case..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "...the victims are always discovered in a locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Uh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Nowhere in the file did it say anything like that. At\n"
"least *try* to remember what it said..."

"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"In every Genocide Jack case, it seems that a bloody\n"
"message is always left behind..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "You're talking about \"bloodlust,\" right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"We know that already. Hurry up and tell them about the\n"
"*other* characteristic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>Looks like I just embarrassed myself\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Surely you know the answer, don't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"<CLT 4>The other characteristic, if I remember correctly, is\n"

"<CLT 4>If I'm not mistaken, it has to do with the positioning\n"
"of the body.\n"
"<CLT>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Apparently, in every Genocide Jack case, the killer\n"
"<CLT 3>suspends the body<CLT> in a certain way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Other than the killer, the only people who know about\n"
"this are the higher-ups in the police department."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"However, Chihiro was most definitely suspended in the\n"
"same way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"So, how did the culprit know about this, when only\n"
"high-level police officials were aware of it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "There's only one logical answer I can think of."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"It's because the culprit in this case...is the real\n"
"Genocide Jack."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "No fuckin' way!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "You're saying Genocide Jack...is one of us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Yes. In fact, it's Toko."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Wh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "Genocide Jack's true identity...is Toko Fukawa."

msgctxt "0045"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Wh-Wh-Wh-What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Hey, okay, wait, hold on a sec!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Toko has like, bloodophobia or whatever, remember?\n"
"What kind of serial killer is afraid of blood!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "Is Toko Genocide Jack? The answer is yes...and no."

msgctxt "0036"

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "I'm going to get stronger...and accept who I am..."

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"With that thought at the front of his mind, he\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "And so..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"That day, he made the commitment to begin exercising.\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "But sadly..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"That would be the first and only chance he would get\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"When he'd decided to start exercising, he thought it\n"
"would be good to ask for someone's help."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"But he wanted to tell that person his secret first,\n"
"and then ask them to help him from there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "And the person he went to..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "It was me...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "Yup, it sure was!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"The biker gang fella had been painfully clear about\n"
"how important his <CLT 3>manly promises<CLT> were."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"So Chihiro probably figured that even if he confided\n"
"in Mondo, his honor would make him keep the secret."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Plus, Mr. Macho Mondo was the very symbol of a <CLT 3>strong\n"
"man<CLT> that Chihiro had always aspired to."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Maybe talking to Mondo about it will help give me some\n"
"courage..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "So he went and asked Mondo to help him become strong!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "That was his aspiration..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"And he thought that only with Mondo's support would\n"
"he ever be able to come close to that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"So then, that must be why Mondo <CLT 3>did what he did<CLT>—to\n"
"keep the promise he'd made to Chihiro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Huh? Did what he did?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"You mean...? That's why Mondo carried Chihiro from the\n"
"boys locker room into the girls locker room?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "Yes, that's exactly what I mean."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Wasn't that to cover up what he'd done?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"That could have been part of it, but I don't think it\n"
"was the main reason."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"The real purpose was to keep the <CLT 3>promise between men<CLT>\n"
"he'd made to Chihiro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "But...how does moving the body keep his secret?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Because if everyone knew he'd been killed in the boys\n"
"locker room..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"...then everyone would have been arguing about how\n"
"\"she\" got into the *boys* locker room, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"Once that started up, at least a few of us would have\n"
"immediately begun to suspect his identity. So..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"He tried to protect Chihiro's secret by putting him in\n"
"the girls locker room and stealing his handbook. See?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"Then...Mondo did all that to keep the promise he'd\n"
"made to Chihiro...who he'd also killed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "Why...would he...do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"The more I hear you talk, the more I don't understand!\n"
"I mean, you guys trusted each other, right!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "So why? Why did you...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"Because...no matter what, I didn't want anyone to\n"
"know..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "So that's what triggered it, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"The possibility of having your <CLT 3>embarrassing memories<CLT>\n"
"and <CLT 3>secrets<CLT> exposed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"Th-That's impossible! Nothing could have been that\n"
"bad!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"Something he didn't want anyone to know, even if it\n"
"meant killing someone...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "It's impossible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "How many times must I repeat myself?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"To judge others by your own standard is the height of\n"
"folly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"Even if you can't comprehend it, he obviously can.\n"
"That's all there is to it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"Well, while we're on the subject...why don't I tell\n"
"you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"

msgid "Mondo's older brother's name was <CLT 3>Daiya Owada<CLT>."

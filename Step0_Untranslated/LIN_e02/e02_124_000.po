"First, let's take a look back to before the\n"
"incident..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Last night, Celeste saw Chihiro in the <CLT 3>warehouse<CLT>,\n"
"correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"At the time, she was apparently stuffing something\n"
"into a <CLT 3>duffel bag<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"That \"something\" was a <CLT 3>blue tracksuit<CLT>. You can\n"
"confirm this, right Celeste?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"With bag in hand, Chihiro headed out, even though it\n"
"was officially nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"She made her way to the locker room. Specifically, the\n"
"<CLT 3>boys locker room<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"But how could the <CLT 3>victim<CLT>, who was apparently a girl,\n"
"access the boys locker room?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "Simple. Because \"she\" was really a <CLT 3>he<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Which is why he was able to use his own <CLT 3>e-Handbook<CLT>\n"
"to gain entrance to the boys locker room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Once inside, he met with someone there. And the\n"
"<CLT 3>person<CLT> he met was the one who <CLT 3>killed him<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"It seems likely that the killer grabbed the nearby\n"
"<CLT 3>dumbbell<CLT>, approached the unsuspecting Chihiro..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "...and attacked him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"And that's where the <CLT 3>bloodstains<CLT> on the <CLT 3>poster<CLT> and\n"
"carpeting in the boys locker room came from."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"It was likely in the heat of the moment. The body was\n"
"arranged, but the murder itself felt unplanned."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Which is why the killer hurried to try and <CLT 3>hide the\n"
"act<CLT>. First, pulling up the bloodstained carpet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "...then removing the bloody poster..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"...and finally carrying the corpse into the <CLT 3>girls\n"
"locker room<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"A girl's handbook was necessary to get into the locker\n"
"room, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"But this alone doesn't prove that the killer was\n"
"necessarily a girl."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"After all, <CLT 3>Sayaka<CLT> and <CLT 3>Junko's<CLT> handbooks had been\n"
"placed in the main hall."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Using one of those, <CLT 3>a boy could get into the girls\n"
"locker room<CLT> without much problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "And that's exactly how the killer did it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"With the carpet and the poster they'd brought with\n"
"them, they <CLT 3>got to work<CLT>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"They changed the layout of the boys and girls locker\n"
"room, in what you might call...a <CLT 3>crime scene switch<CLT>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "That could have been the end of things, but no..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"Byakuya discovered the body and decided to...intervene\n"
"in the situation, making things even more complicated."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "So, after stumbling on the crime scene..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"...he went and grabbed the <CLT 3>extension cord<CLT> from the\n"
"library, and then *he* <CLT 3>got to work<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"...He used the cord to <CLT 3>string up<CLT> Chihiro's lifeless\n"
"body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Then, using the victim's own blood, he left a <CLT 3>grisly\n"
"message<CLT> there at the scene of the crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"He wanted to create the illusion that <CLT 3>Genocide Jack\n"
"was responsible<CLT> for the slaughter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"And around the same time that Byakuya was putting\n"
"together this facade..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"...the killer, having already disposed of Chihiro's\n"
"bag and other belongings, arrived at the <CLT 3>sauna<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"There, they planned to destroy the last piece of\n"
"evidence...Chihiro's handbook."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"And just as the killer expected, the <CLT 3>steamy sauna<CLT>\n"
"was enough to ruin the electronic gadget."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Somehow, the killer knew that the handbook couldn't\n"
"stand up to the <CLT 3>heat of the sauna<CLT>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"And the reason they knew that is because the sauna had\n"
"already wrecked their own handbook!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "...And that's how it all played out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Isn't that right, <CLT 3>Mondo Owada<CLT>!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
